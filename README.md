## About the Project

This project is intended to help MobilityCorp achieve its business goals and address its biggest business challenges by offering the most optimal technology stack and architectural solution. The company's goals are: 
- increase sales and revenue
- expand market coverage
- improve user experience
- strengthen its market position.

**Objectives** of the current project will serve as key enablers for these goals.

## Objectives

Design from scratch (green field architecture) functionality for:
- **User Dialogue** - enhanced sales via user-personalized companionship, adaptive route/experience/pricing/charging advise, and driving compliance guidance
- **Dynamic Pricing** - sales support with more competitive pricing, addresses expansion ambitions and retention goals
- **Demand Forecasting** - uses internal and external data (weather, traffic, events) to forecast demand
- **Maintenance Optimization** (cost reduction) via:
  - Operational efficiency (location/fleet/route supply optimisation, transportation/charge task assignment)
  - Load distribution (even rental/usage among vehicles)
  - Maintenance prediction (sensor data - e.g. battery)
 
  , while ensuring continuous and smooth system operation of the existing core rental functionality.

## Solution Overview
**Scope**
Design a micro-mobility platform for connected scooters, e-bikes, cars, and vans. Focus on near-real-time telemetry, fleet state, pricing and demand intelligence, maintenance dispatch, and conversational assistants. 

### Repository Structure

- `adrs/` â†’ Architecture Decision Records 
- `requirements/` â†’ Business & technical requirements
- `hld/` â†’ High Level Design artefacts (diagrams, docs)

### Target Architecture at a Glance  

**Edge and connectivity**

- Vehicles use MQTT over cellular
- Clustered MQTT gateway on GKE behind external load balancer
- Gateway authenticates devices, buffers if offline, and publishes telemetry to Pub/Sub topics by region and vehicle type

**Streaming and integration**
- Pub/Sub as event backbone for telemetry and commands
- Dataflow pipelines for parsing, validation, dedupe, geofencing enrichment, road snapping, and fan-out to storage and APIs

**State and data**
- Fleet Service is the single source of truth for vehicle state
- BigQuery for analytical models, reporting, pricing inputs, and demand forecasting features.

**AI and GenAI**
- Vertex AI for model lifecycle and evaluation
- Gemini for map grounded conversational search and ops copilots
- Matching Engine and BigQuery vector search for retrieval and RAG
- Agent Builder for tool calling and orchestration of fleet, maps, and pricing tools

**Applications**
- Cloud Run microservices for booking, pricing, ops, maintenance
- API Gateway for external and mobile access
- Identity Platform for auth

**Geospatial and UX**
- Maps Platform for routing, POI, geocoding, traffic and ETA
- Ops UI and mobile client consume APIs and AI assistants
