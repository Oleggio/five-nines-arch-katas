## 📌 Overview

This repository documents the end-to-end architecture thinking process for the given kata scenario.  
It focuses on:
- Clear articulation of **requirements**
- Well-structured **design decisions**
- Concise and visual **high-level design**

The aim is to provide **transparency, traceability, and clarity** for reviewers and collaborators.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Ensure smooth system operations (design from scratch - green field)
- Dynamic Pricing - more competitive pricing, addresses expansion ambitions and retention goals
- Demand Forecasting - uses internal and external data (weather, traffic, events) to forecast demand
- Maintenance
- - Operational Efficience: Supply Optimisation
- - Maintenance Prediction (sensor data - e.g. battery)

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `adrs/` → Architecture Decision Records 
- `requirements/` → Business & technical requirements
- `hld/` → High Level Design artefacts (diagrams, docs)

## 📝 How to Review

1. **Start with** `requirements/` to understand the problem space.  
2. **Review** `adrs/` to follow the decision trail.  
3. **Explore** `hld/` for high-level architecture views and solution outline.  
4. Return here for **conclusion and summary** (to be added later in the kata lifecycle).

_This is a living document. It will evolve as the kata progresses._
