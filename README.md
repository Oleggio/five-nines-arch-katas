## Solution Overview
**Scope**
Design a micro-mobility platform for connected scooters, e-bikes, cars, and vans. Focus on near-real-time telemetry, fleet state, pricing and demand intelligence, maintenance dispatch, and conversational assistants. 

## Objectives

Design from scratch (green field architecture) functionality for:
- **User Dialogue** - enhanced sales via user-personalized companionship, adaptive route/experience/pricing/charging advise, and driving compliance guidance
- **Dynamic Pricing** - sales support with more competitive pricing, addresses expansion ambitions and retention goals
- **Demand Forecasting** - uses internal and external data (weather, traffic, events) to forecast demand
- **Maintenance Optimization** (cost reduction) via:
  - Operational efficiency (location/fleet/route supply optimisation, transportation/charge task assignment)
  - Load distribution (even rental/usage among vehicles)
  - Maintenance prediction (sensor data - e.g. battery)
 
  , while ensuring continuous and smooth system operation of the existing core rental functionality.
