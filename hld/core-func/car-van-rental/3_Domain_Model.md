## Aggregate Consistency Boundaries

### Transactional Consistency (Strong)
Within a single aggregate, changes are **ACID-compliant** and immediately consistent:

- **Reservation Aggregate**: Booking details, pre-auth reference, recurring pattern rules
- **Rental Aggregate**: Session state, billing accumulator, current telemetry snapshot
- **Payment Record Aggregate**: Transaction state, fine calculations, refund tracking
- **Vehicle Status Aggregate**: Availability flag, location, charge level, maintenance state

### Eventual Consistency (Across Aggregates)
Cross-aggregate updates use **domain events** for eventual consistency:

- **Reservation â†’ Vehicle**: `ReservationCreated` event updates Vehicle availability (eventually consistent)
- **Rental â†’ Payment**: Billing events accumulate charges asynchronously
- **Cleanliness â†’ Crew**: Assessment triggers task creation via event
- **Charging â†’ Vehicle**: Charge completion updates vehicle status via telemetry events

**Rationale:** 
- Prevents distributed transactions across bounded contexts
- Enables independent scaling of aggregates
- Maintains system resilience during partial failures
- Supports event sourcing for audit trails

### Key Relationships

**1. Customer/Corporate â†’ Reservation (1:Many)**
- One customer can have multiple active reservations
- One corporate account can have reservations across multiple employees
- Enforced at application layer, not FK constraint

**2. Reservation â†’ Rental (1:1)**
- Each reservation may spawn one active rental session
- Rental references reservation ID but doesn't require FK
- Decoupled for flexibility (walk-up rentals in future)

**3. Rental â†’ Vehicle (Many:1)**
- Multiple rentals (over time) reference same vehicle
- Vehicle status updated via events, not direct FK

**4. Rental â†’ Payment (1:Many)**
- One rental generates multiple payment records (pre-auth, charges, fines)
- Payment aggregate references rental ID for correlation

**5. Vehicle â†’ Crew Task (1:Many)**
- One vehicle may have multiple pending crew tasks
- Tasks reference vehicle ID but remain independent aggregate

**6. Rental â†’ Cleanliness Assessment (1:1)**
- Each rental completion triggers one cleanliness assessment
- Assessment may exist independently for pre-rental checks

## Design Rationale

### Why These Aggregate Boundaries?

1. **Reservation as Aggregate Root:**
   - Booking is the customer's primary interaction point
   - Encapsulates all booking-related rules (conflicts, extensions, recurring patterns)
   - Pre-authorization lifecycle tied to reservation state

2. **Rental as Separate Aggregate:**
   - Active session has different lifecycle than booking
   - Billing accumulates in real-time during rental
   - Telemetry streaming requires separate scalability profile
   - Decoupling enables walk-up rentals (future scope)

3. **Vehicle Status as Aggregate:**
   - Vehicle is shared resource across many rentals
   - Real-time availability requires independent consistency
   - Charge level updated by telemetry, not rental events
   - Maintenance state managed by operations, not customers

4. **Payment Record as Aggregate:**
   - Financial transactions require audit trail isolation
   - Compliance mandates independent payment records
   - Enables payment gateway failures without blocking rentals
   - Supports complex refund/chargeback workflows

**5. Crew Task as Aggregate:**
   - Operations domain separate from customer rentals
   - Route optimization requires batch processing
   - Task assignment independent of vehicle availability
   - Enables crew mobile app to work offline

6. **Dispute as Aggregate:**
   - Customer disputes require independent audit trail
   - Evidence management (photos, timestamps) isolated from payment flow
   - Review workflow with SLA tracking (48h submission, 5-day decision)
   - Enables escalation path separate from original transaction

7. **Damage Assessment as Separate Aggregate (from Cleanliness):**
   - Damage detection requires different AI models (object detection vs classification)
   - Repair cost estimation workflow distinct from cleaning fees
   - Insurance integration separate concern
   - Enables parallel processing of cleanliness and damage at return

8. **Corporate Account as Aggregate:**
   - B2B billing domain separate from individual customers
   - Multi-tenant employee management with access controls
   - Usage cap enforcement requires independent transaction boundary
   - Consolidated reporting requires separate data lifecycle

9. **Telemetry as Value Object:**
   - High-frequency time-series data (30-second intervals)
   - Immutable records, no business logic
   - Optimized for streaming ingestion and analytics
   - Not an aggregate root (no identity required)

10. **Loyalty Tier as Value Object (Embedded in Customer):**
   - Tier calculation based on rolling 30-day usage
   - Discount rules tightly coupled to customer identity
   - Auto-upgrade/downgrade logic embedded in Customer aggregate
   - Not independent entity (no lifecycle outside Customer)

11. **Recurring Pattern as Value Object (Embedded in Reservation):**
   - Recurrence rules (frequency, end date) owned by reservation
   - Skip history tracked within reservation context
   - Pattern expiration managed by reservation lifecycle
   - Not independent entity (no meaning without parent reservation)
