# Core Functionality Overview

## Overview

MobiCorp's core services support the fundamental business operations,
enabling users to discover, reserve, and ride e-bikes, scooters, cars and vans across the city.
The platform is built on GCP ([ADR-0001](../../adrs/ADR-0001%20-%20GCP%20as%20main%20cloud%20provider.md)) to leverage native Maps integration,
scalable real-time data handling, and seamless AI/ML capabilities.
Vehicle connectivity is maintained through MQTT gateways integrated with GCP IoT Platform ([ADR-0002](../../adrs/ADR-0002%20-%20Vehicle%20telemetry%20&%20integration%20stack.md)),
ensuring reliable telemetry and command exchange for thousands of connected devices.

> **Note:** Detailed architectural documentation for the **Car/Van Rental** bounded context (including context diagrams, container architecture, domain model, and sequence diagrams) is available in [`car-van-rental/`](car-van-rental/README.md). Cars and vans are modeled separately due to distinct patterns: advance bookings, longer durations, charging infrastructure, complex return verification, and corporate account support. To review it you should start with [README.md](./car-van-rental/README.md) file.
