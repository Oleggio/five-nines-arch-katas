# ADR-0001 — Cloud Provider Selection
## Context
We are building a micro-mobility solution (e-bikes, scooters, car-sharing) requiring real-time tracking, routing, payments, analytics, and scalable fleet management.

## Decision
We choose **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** as the core cloud provider.

## Key Differentiators

- **Seamless Maps & Location Services Integration**  
  Native Google Maps APIs for routing, geofencing, traffic-aware navigation, and real-time vehicle tracking. No additional integration layer needed, unlike AWS or Azure.

- **High-Performance Real-Time Data Handling**  
  BigQuery, Pub/Sub, and Dataflow allow near-instant analytics and event processing across fleets, enabling smarter fleet management and predictive maintenance.

- **Scalability & Global Network**  
  GCP’s global backbone ensures low-latency services for users in multiple cities, which is crucial for real-time micromobility operations.

- **AI/ML Integration Made Easy**  
  Vertex AI and AutoML enable demand prediction, route optimization, and user behavior insights without managing separate ML infrastructure.

- **Operational Efficiency & Dev Experience**  
  Tight integration between services reduces engineering overhead, accelerates development, and ensures smooth deployment pipelines.

## Alternatives Considered
- **AWS**: Strong compute and storage, but requires third-party mapping integration; heavier ML setup.  
- **Azure**: Enterprise-friendly, but mapping and real-time fleet analytics require more custom work.  

## Competitors

Also GCP is popular among car sharing companies, e.g. Zoomcar: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/themainstream_themainstream-zoomcar-googlecloudai-activity-7359225564924100608-zxnx/

## Conclusion
GCP is the most **integrated, real-time, and ML-ready platform** for micro-mobility solutions. Its native Maps APIs, global network, and streamlined data/AI services make it the optimal choice over AWS and Azure.
