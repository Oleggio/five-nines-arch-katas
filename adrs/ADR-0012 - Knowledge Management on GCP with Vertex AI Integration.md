## Context
Knowledge management is the foundation for GenAI applications. It requires secure, scalable storage and processing of structured and unstructured data, supporting ingestion pipelines and efficient retrieval. This can be implemented on various platforms, including Azure and Databricks. To align with the overall GCP and Vertex AI strategy, we select a GCP-native data platform.

## Decision
Use BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and Dataflow for ingestion, transformation, and storage of knowledge data, integrated with Vertex AI for model training and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios.

## Key Differentiators
- Native integration with Vertex AI for RAG workflows.
- Low-latency querying and vector search capabilities in BigQuery.
- Scalable ingestion and processing using Dataflow.
- Strong security and IAM integration.

## Consideration_1 - Unified Data Platform
Using GCP unifies data ingestion, processing, and retrieval in a single platform, reducing integration complexity and accelerating development.

## Alternatives Considered
- Azure Data Lake + Cognitive Search: good integration but higher effort to integrate with Vertex AI.
- Databricks: flexible but more complex operational model.
- Hybrid stack: adds latency and complexity.

## Risks & Trade-offs

| Risk Area | Description | Mitigation |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Vendor lock-in | Dependence on GCP services | Keep interfaces modular and document fallback options |
| Cost | High-volume data processing costs | Cost monitoring and optimization |
| Data residency | Compliance with data protection laws | Regional deployment and policies |

## Conclusion
GCP provides a strong native integration with Vertex AI, making it the most efficient platform for knowledge management in this architecture.
