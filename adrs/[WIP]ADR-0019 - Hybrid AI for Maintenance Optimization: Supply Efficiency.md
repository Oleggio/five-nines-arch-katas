# ADR-0019 - Hybrid AI for Maintenance Optimization: Supply Efficiency

## Context

The rental platform operates a large and geographically distributed fleet of vehicles (scooters, cars, vans, e-bikes).  
Operational efficiency depends on optimizing **vehicle supply**, **charging**, and **maintenance** tasks executed by the field (Ops) team — particularly during off-peak hours.

Functional Requirements [FR#2H](/requirements/2_FRs.md) and [FR#2I](/requirements/2_FRs.md) define:
> “Calculate supply (vehicle movement) route and timing, calculate charging tasks for the operational team in the night.”  
> “Calculate recommended load distribution (even rental/usage among vehicles), then suggest a vehicle to book from the location.”

These scenarios aim to:
- evenly distribute wear across the fleet (reduce overuse of certain vehicles)
- optimize nightly relocation and charging routes for the Ops team
- reduce idle time and maintenance cost through predictive insights
- integrate with demand forecasting ([FR#2G](/requirements/2_FRs.md)) for pre-emptive supply positioning

Traditional rule-based scheduling or manual planning is inefficient when managing hundreds of vehicles across multiple districts.  
A **Hybrid AI** approach (ML + GenAI + rule-based logic) ensures continuous optimization, explainability, and compliance with logistical and safety constraints.
