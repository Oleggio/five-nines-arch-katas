# Risks & Mitigation Strategies

[WIP]

| Risk Area | Description | Mitigation |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Vendor lock-in | Focus on GCP services only (single cloud), deep use of Vertex AI | Use abstraction layers for critical services where feasible; document fallback options |
| Cost | Managed features can be expensive | Usage controls and monitoring |
| Team skills | Vertex AI, IoT expertise required | Training and documentation |
