**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User searches availability for vehicle type, location, date/time, duration
- [ ] System calculates required range based on duration (assume average 50km/hour usage)
- [ ] System adds 20% buffer to required range for safety margin
- [ ] Booking rejected if vehicle's current range < required range
- [ ] User shown alternative vehicles with sufficient charge
- [ ] Booking creates reservation with payment pre-authorization hold
- [ ] System prevents double-booking with pessimistic locking

**Business Rules:**
- Maximum advance booking: 7 days
- Minimum rental duration: 1 hour
- Maximum single rental: 7 days (168 hours)
- Charge buffer: 20% above estimated consumption
- Pre-auth amount: (Duration × Rate) + 20% buffer + Maximum potential fines (€200)

### FR-CV-004: Booking Extension with Conflict Checking
**Business Goal:** Flexible rental duration while preventing double-booking

**Description:** Customers can request to extend active rentals. System checks for conflicting next bookings before approval.

**Source:** Transcript Q&A - "For cars and vans, yes, they can ask to extend... but somebody else might have booked that vehicle"

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User requests extension from mobile app during active rental
- [ ] System checks if vehicle has next reservation within requested extension period
- [ ] If no conflict: Auto-approve extension, update billing, send confirmation
- [ ] If conflict exists: Deny extension, show conflict time, suggest alternative vehicles nearby
- [ ] Extension updates pre-authorization hold for additional amount
- [ ] System logs all extension requests for demand analysis

**Business Rules:**
- Maximum extension: Original duration × 2 (e.g., 4h booking can extend max 8h total)
- Extension pricing: Same per-minute rate as original booking
- Minimum extension increment: 30 minutes
- Extension deadline: Cannot extend beyond 7-day maximum rental

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Next booking exists: System calculates required buffer time = Return time (30 min) + Charging time (variable based on current charge level)
- Charging time estimation: Based on vehicle's current charge, target charge for next booking, and charger capacity
- Extension allowed only if: Current rental end + Extension duration + Buffer time ≤ Next booking start
- Example: Next booking needs 80% charge, vehicle at 40%, charging takes ~2 hours → Buffer = 30min + 120min = 150min
- If insufficient time: Deny extension, suggest shorter duration or alternative vehicle

**Error Scenarios:**
- Conflict exists → Suggest nearby alternative vehicles or shorter extension
- Payment authorization fails → Extension denied, user must return at original time
- Vehicle malfunction during rental → Extension not allowed, roadside assistance dispatched

**Dependencies:**
- Rental Lifecycle Service (active rental tracking)
- Booking Service (reservation conflict checking)
- Vehicle Status Manager (current charge level, charging time estimation)
- Payment Service (pre-auth adjustment)
- Notification Service (conflict alerts)

- [ ] Price adjustment calculated automatically (difference charged/refunded)
- [ ] Original pre-authorization adjusted if price increases
- [ ] Modification confirmation sent via email/SMS with updated details
- [ ] Booking reference number remains unchanged
- [ ] Modification history tracked for audit

**Modification Scenarios:**

**1. Time Extension/Reduction:**
- Extend rental duration → Calculate price difference, adjust pre-auth, confirm availability
- Shorten rental duration → Calculate refund amount, release excess pre-auth, update vehicle schedule
- Validation: New end time must not conflict with subsequent bookings

**2. Date/Time Change:**
- Move reservation to different date/time → Check vehicle availability, recalculate pricing (demand-based)
- Price may increase or decrease based on new time slot demand
- Original vehicle prioritized, alternative suggested if unavailable

**3. Vehicle Type Change:**
- Upgrade (car → van) → Calculate price difference, check availability, adjust pre-auth
- Downgrade (van → car) → Refund difference, release excess pre-auth
- Vehicle-specific features preserved (e.g., child seat, bike rack)

**4. Location Change:**
- Change pickup location → Validate new location has availability
- Change return location → Recalculate any location-based fees
- Cross-border implications checked if applicable

**Business Rules:**
- Modification deadline: 1 hour before scheduled start (buffer for crew preparation)
- Price lock: Original booking price protected if modified >24 hours in advance
- Price adjustment: Dynamic pricing applies if modified <24 hours before start
- Multiple modifications: Allowed (no limit), but each modification extends 1-hour deadline
- Recurring bookings: Can modify template (affects future occurrences) or individual occurrence
- Availability: If modified parameters unavailable, system suggests alternatives or modification fails

**Pricing Impact:**
- Price increase: Charge difference to original payment method, adjust pre-auth
- Price decrease: Refund difference or adjust pre-auth down (customer choice)
- Modification fee: None (free modifications to encourage flexibility over cancellation)
- Pricing transparency: "Original price: €45, New price: €52, Difference: +€7"

**Validation Rules:**
- Start time: Cannot be in the past, must be ≥1 hour from now
- End time: Must be after start time, maximum rental duration applies (7 days)
- Vehicle availability: Real-time check, 5-minute reservation lock during modification
- Payment method: Must be valid and have sufficient funds for price increases
- Customer eligibility: Account in good standing, no outstanding disputes

**Error Scenarios:**

## 2. Vehicle Access & Lifecycle

### FR-CV-005: Dual Access Control (Phone NFC + Remote Unlock)
**Business Goal:** Reliable access with fallback mechanism

**Description:** Customers use their smartphone's NFC capability via mobile app as primary unlock method, with remote unlock API as fallback.

**Source:** Transcript - "Customers have a mobile device that is NFC capable... put their mobile device next to the vehicle to unlock it"

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Mobile app leverages phone's built-in NFC hardware
- [ ] Customer taps phone (with app open or in background) on vehicle's NFC reader → Vehicle unlocks within 2 seconds
- [ ] NFC unlock transmits: Customer ID, reservation ID, timestamp (signed with app credentials)
- [ ] If NFC fails: Mobile app "Remote Unlock" button triggers API call to Vehicle IoT Gateway
- [ ] Unlock succeeds only if: Reservation active, customer authorized, vehicle available
- [ ] Unlock event triggers rental session start (billing begins)
- [ ] Unlock logs: timestamp, method (NFC/Remote API), location, vehicle ID

**Business Rules:**
- Unlock window: 15 minutes before reservation start time to 30 minutes after
- After 30 minutes late: Reservation auto-cancelled, pre-auth released (minus no-show fee)
- Remote unlock rate limit: Max 5 attempts per minute (prevent abuse)

**Technical Requirements:**
- NFC protocol: ISO 14443 Type A/B (industry standard for contactless)
- NFC payload: Encrypted token with reservation validation data
- API timeout: 5 seconds max for remote unlock
- Fallback: If both NFC + API fail → Customer support notification, manual unlock by operations

**Error Handling:**
- Phone NFC disabled/unavailable → Guide customer to enable NFC or use remote unlock

**Source:** Mentioned in FR-CV-005 - "After 30 minutes late: Reservation auto-cancelled, pre-auth released (minus no-show fee)"

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Grace period: 15 minutes after reservation start time (no penalty)
- [ ] Late arrival (15-30 min): Customer can still unlock vehicle, no fee
- [ ] No-show (>30 min): Reservation auto-cancelled, no-show fee charged
- [ ] Customer notified at 15 minutes (reminder to unlock or cancel)
- [ ] No-show fee: €25 (flat fee, configurable by region)
- [ ] Fee charged against pre-authorization, remainder released
- [ ] Vehicle status updated to "Available" for immediate rebooking
- [ ] Customer can dispute no-show fee if legitimate reason (e.g., traffic, emergency)

**Late Arrival Scenarios:**
- **0-15 minutes late:** No penalty, rental starts when unlocked
- **15-30 minutes late:** Warning SMS sent, rental still available
- **30+ minutes late:** Auto-cancelled, no-show fee applied

**No-Show Fee Justification:**
- Compensates for lost revenue opportunity
- Discourages habitual no-shows
- Lower than full rental cost (fair to customer)
- Waived for first offense per customer (goodwill)

**Business Rules:**
- Grace period: 15 minutes (no fee)
- No-show threshold: 30 minutes after reservation start
- Fee amount: €25 (or 1 hour equivalent rental cost, whichever lower)
- First-time waiver: First no-show in 12 months automatically waived
- Recurring no-shows: >3 in 6 months may trigger account restrictions
- Dispute window: 48 hours (links to FR-CV-020 Dispute Resolution)

**Customer Communication:**
- Booking confirmation: "Please arrive within 15 minutes of start time"
- 15-minute reminder: "Reservation starts in 15 minutes. Unlock vehicle or cancel to avoid fees."

**Exception Handling:**
- Traffic/Accident: Customer can report via app, extends grace period
- Vehicle malfunction: No-show fee waived if vehicle unavailable
- App/NFC failure: Customer contacts support, manual unlock, no fee
- Roadside assistance called: No-show fee waived

**Analytics & Patterns:**
- Track no-show rate by customer, location, time of day
- High no-show locations may indicate access issues
- Chronic no-show customers flagged for review
- No-show reduction impact on utilization rates

**Integration with Recurring Reservations:**
- Recurring pattern: 24-hour skip notice required (no fee)
- Less than 24 hours: No-show fee applies if not unlocked
- Recurring no-shows (>2) trigger pattern cancellation

**Error Scenarios:**
- Customer unlocks at 29 minutes → Rental starts, no fee
- Customer unlocks at 31 minutes → Rental blocked, no-show fee already applied
- Fee charge fails → Retry processing, escalate if unsuccessful
- Customer disputes → Routed to FR-CV-020 Dispute Resolution workflow

**Dependencies:**
- Booking Service (reservation status, auto-cancellation)
- Rental Lifecycle Service (unlock tracking)
- Payment Service (no-show fee charging)
- Notification Service (reminders, cancellation notices)
- Vehicle Status Manager (availability update)

**Related ADRs:**

## 4. Payment & Pricing

### FR-CV-009: Per-Minute Billing with Pre-Authorization
**Business Goal:** Transparent pricing, prevent payment fraud

**Description:** Time-based billing with upfront pre-authorization hold, final charge calculated at return.

**Source:** Transcript Q&A - "We do pre-authorization... then at the end charge them for actual usage"

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] At booking: Calculate estimated cost (duration × rate) + 20% buffer
- [ ] Place pre-authorization hold on customer's payment method
- [ ] Pre-auth must succeed for booking to complete
- [ ] At rental start: Billing begins (per-minute clock starts)

- [ ] At return: Calculate final charge (minutes used × rate + any fines)
- [ ] Charge final amount, release unused pre-auth within 24 hours
- [ ] Customer receives itemized receipt via email

**Billing Calculation:**
```
Base Charge = (Rental Duration in Minutes) × (Per-Minute Rate for Vehicle Type)
Fines = Late Fee + Wrong Location Fee + Charger Fee + Cleaning Fee
Total Charge = Base Charge + Fines
```

**Pre-Authorization Logic:**
```
Max Possible Cost = (Booked Duration × 1.5) × Rate  // 50% extension buffer
Max Fines = €200  // Late + Location + Charger + Cleaning
Pre-Auth Amount = Max Possible Cost + Max Fines
```

**Business Rules:**
- Billing precision: Per minute (not rounded)
- Rate variation: By vehicle type, loyalty tier, time of day (future)
- Pre-auth expiry: 7 days (for maximum rental duration)
- Failed charge: 3 retry attempts over 48 hours, then collections process

  Late return (45 min × €0.50/min): €22.50
  Wrong location fee: €50.00
  Cleaning fee (Minor): €50.00 WAIVED (first offense)
  ───────────────────────────────────────────
  Subtotal: €135.50
  Tax (19% VAT): €25.75
  ───────────────────────────────────────────
  Total Charged: €161.25
```

**Evidence Collection:**

- Damage: Before/after photo comparison

**Waiver Management:**
- System tracks waiver history per customer
- Waivers reset annually (e.g., one late waiver per calendar year)
- High-value customers (Gold tier): Extended waiver eligibility
- Corporate accounts: Waiver policies set by account admin

**Dispute Resolution Integration:**
- Each fine includes "Dispute This Charge" link
- Dispute submission routes to FR-CV-020 (Dispute Resolution Workflow)
- Pending disputes: Fine charged but refunded if dispute successful
- Dispute decision timeline: 3-5 business days

**Analytics & Reporting:**
- **Fine Revenue:** Total fine revenue by type, trend over time
- **Fine Frequency:** Number of fines per 1000 rentals (benchmark)
- **Waiver Usage:** Waivers applied, waiver abuse patterns
- **Dispute Rate:** Percentage of fines disputed, win/loss rate
- **Customer Impact:** Fine frequency by customer segment, churn correlation
- **Operational Insights:** High-fine locations (parking issues), high-fine times (rush hour late returns)

**Error Scenarios:**
