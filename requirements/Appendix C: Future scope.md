 # Extra ideas for future AI use:

- automatic vehicle inspection (phone scanning) for vehicle pick-up and return;
- fully automated vehicle return process with associated repair/maintenance cost calculation if applicable;
- geo-economic expansion prediction for next market expansion/acquisition;
- in-app trip-based gamification;
- automated incident detection and support;
- AI-augmented route testing;
- accessibility AI.

# Future enhancements for core functionality:

- recurring reservations with advanced patterns (bi-weekly, specific weeks, custom schedules beyond simple daily/weekly);
- additional language support beyond Phase 1 (Romanian, Hungarian, Czech for Eastern European expansion);
- fully personalized adaptive route/experience advice with scenic routing and historical preference learning;
- gamification enhancements to loyalty program (points, badges, challenges, leaderboards for engagement);
- integration with public transit for multi-modal journey planning (seamless mobility hub);
- carbon footprint tracking and reporting (CO2 savings vs car ownership, sustainability metrics);
- peer-to-peer vehicle sharing/subletting (requires complex insurance and liability framework).
