# Assumptions and Constraints

## Assumptions
- **Vehicles/devices**: All vehicles offered for rental are electric ones, require regular recharging and corresponding maintenance.
- **GPS Tracking**: All vehicles have GPS trackers on them. GPS tracker shares information every 30 min.
- **Mobile App**: Mobile application for user experience already exists, covering only core functionality (register, view policies & pricing, reserve, pay, ride, return, lock/unlock, view statistics). See **Appendix A** for details.  
- **Legacy Architecture**: For functionality covered by the project, there is no legacy software system to migrate from. The solution will be built from scratch (greenfield architecture).
