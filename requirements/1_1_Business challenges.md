# Business Challenges & Pain Points

## Business Challenges

- Highly competitive market and fragmented demand (multiple transport options, peak times at specific locations/directions)
- Unpredictable and uneven maintenance costs per vehicle (service, charging, transporting, etc.)
- Difficulty of scaling up with current pricing and operational model


## Pain Points of the Business

- Poor vehicle availability at the right locations and times.
- Unpredictable battery charge status â€” frequent downtime or out-of-charge vehicles resulting in decreased customer satisfaction.
- Manual or inefficient fleet relocation and charging planning.
- Rigid or suboptimal pricing not aligned with real-time demand.
- Lack of proactive engagement with users (no personalized recommendations). Customer satisfaction is out of control.
- Operational visibility gaps in real-time vehicle status, usage patterns, and predictive maintenance.
- Regulatory requirements and license limitations vary per location. Non-compliant usage of vehicles results in extra costs for bringing them back to territories of allowed usage.
