And our host for today's event is Sam Newman.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8734652996063232

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:24.295
He is a technologist focusing on the areas of cloud,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8734652996063232

00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:29.111
micro services and continuous delivery, 3 topics which seem to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8734652996063232

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:29.800
overlap.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8823456168174744

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.007
He also provides consulting, training and advisory services to startups

He is also an author and experience conference speaker.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9449953436851501

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.460
Now we'll get started and I'll hand things over to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9449953436851501

00:01:53.518 --> 00:01:54.040
our host.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8799505233764648

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.960
Hi, Sam.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6269570589065552

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.480
Hi, Joan.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8744801878929138

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.511
Thank you so much indeed for the lovely introduction and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8744801878929138

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.574
thank you everybody to coming along today to participate in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8744801878929138

00:02:04.642 --> 00:02:07.080
the architectural characters for Q4.

NOTE Confidence: 0.849392294883728

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.092
We're looking at the whole idea of creating architecture which

NOTE Confidence: 0.849392294883728

00:02:12.167 --> 00:02:15.244
can be AI enabled and we've kind of got a

NOTE Confidence: 0.849392294883728

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.120
fun thing for you today.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8484795093536377

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.344
This slide being a little bit of a of a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8484795093536377

00:02:19.397 --> 00:02:22.573
teaser regarding the problem that you're going to be solving

NOTE Confidence: 0.8484795093536377

00:02:22.626 --> 00:02:24.320
for all of us within your teams.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7523991465568542

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.614
Before we get into it, sharing with you what with

NOTE Confidence: 0.7523991465568542

00:02:27.663 --> 00:02:29.979
the what the problem is going to be and talking

NOTE Confidence: 0.7523991465568542

00:02:30.028 --> 00:02:32.393
through the process by how these cat is going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7523991465568542

00:02:32.442 --> 00:02:32.640
run.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8467775583267212

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.521
I thought it'd be a good idea to just really

NOTE Confidence: 0.8467775583267212

00:02:35.577 --> 00:02:38.115
explain what a cat is and what the purpose of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8467775583267212

00:02:38.172 --> 00:02:38.679
a cat is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8366507291793823

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.083
Now the concept of a cat is actually first came

NOTE Confidence: 0.8366507291793823

00:02:42.138 --> 00:02:43.799
from the area of martial arts.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8615339994430542

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.602
A catter was something which you would do over and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8615339994430542

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:50.658
over again to practice a move or set of moves

NOTE Confidence: 0.8615339994430542

00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:52.319
or practice a technique.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7415919303894043

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.040
We then see catters being used, the concepts of code.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8167756795883179

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.580
The really useful Code Catter site which I used to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8167756795883179

00:02:58.631 --> 00:03:01.171
use years ago would give you like a little problem

NOTE Confidence: 0.8167756795883179

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:01.680
to solve.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7801220417022705

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.600
So in trying to learn a new programming language, you

NOTE Confidence: 0.7801220417022705

00:03:04.653 --> 00:03:07.226
could go get a problem from the Code Catter site

NOTE Confidence: 0.7801220417022705

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:09.584
and come up with a little bit of a solution

NOTE Confidence: 0.7801220417022705

00:03:09.637 --> 00:03:10.120
for that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.91236811876297

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.894
The idea being that it's not a real world use

NOTE Confidence: 0.91236811876297

00:03:12.948 --> 00:03:16.006
of your programming skills, but you're getting to sort of

NOTE Confidence: 0.91236811876297

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.080
practice something.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8796654343605042

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.556
You're getting to try something out, build something kind of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8796654343605042

00:03:20.608 --> 00:03:23.777
real, but without necessarily needing all the time and energy

NOTE Confidence: 0.8796654343605042

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:24.920
resources to do that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8650797605514526

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.214
Now, of course, with coding we can write something and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8650797605514526

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.599
turn it around quite quickly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8600355982780457

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.440
Architecture becomes that little bit more difficult again.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8106693625450134

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.980
And so then we move on to the architectural catches

NOTE Confidence: 0.8106693625450134

00:03:37.036 --> 00:03:39.559
that Ted New had came up with many years ago.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8037852048873901

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.064
And Ted's idea was, well, we've got code catters, why

NOTE Confidence: 0.8037852048873901

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.879
don't we come up with some architectural catters?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8417417407035828

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.717
So with an architectural catter, you outline a problem, a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8417417407035828

00:03:49.774 --> 00:03:52.330
context, and then you try and come up with an

NOTE Confidence: 0.8417417407035828

00:03:52.387 --> 00:03:55.000
architecture to solve that particular problem.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8734973073005676

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.438
One of the challenges, of course, being that whenever you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8734973073005676

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:01.128
look at an architecture for a system, there can often

NOTE Confidence: 0.8734973073005676

00:04:01.178 --> 00:04:03.320
be lots of right ways in which to solve it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8063192367553711

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.551
And so one of the things we're going to be

NOTE Confidence: 0.8063192367553711

00:04:05.604 --> 00:04:07.676
looking for you to do is to look at all

NOTE Confidence: 0.8063192367553711

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:11.024
the different, you know, bring you together, your skills, your

NOTE Confidence: 0.8063192367553711

00:04:11.077 --> 00:04:13.839
understanding of technology and the context to them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8692691326141357

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.745
Propose an architecture to solve the problems of this particular

NOTE Confidence: 0.8692691326141357

00:04:17.806 --> 00:04:18.600
organization.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8910347819328308

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.104
This is an opportunity for you to practice the art

NOTE Confidence: 0.8910347819328308

00:04:22.164 --> 00:04:25.446
of architecture, which is not just about coming up with

NOTE Confidence: 0.8910347819328308

00:04:25.506 --> 00:04:26.759
the right technology.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8410601019859314

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.113
It's about thinking about the system holistically, understanding where trade-offs

NOTE Confidence: 0.8410601019859314

00:04:31.163 --> 00:04:31.960
need to be made.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9104915857315063

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.400
Architecture is also very much about communication.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8679711222648621

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:39.016
If you're responsible for coming up with an architecture, that's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8679711222648621

00:04:39.066 --> 00:04:39.960
not enough, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8653973340988159

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.952
You have to communicate with people, with the people around

NOTE Confidence: 0.8653973340988159

00:04:43.003 --> 00:04:44.880
you that will then build that system.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7980501055717468

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:48.180
Although, of course, in the context of an architectural caster,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7980501055717468

00:04:48.226 --> 00:04:50.989
the people you're going to be communicating are actually our

NOTE Confidence: 0.7980501055717468

00:04:51.035 --> 00:04:53.383
judges who are going to be looking at your solution

NOTE Confidence: 0.7980501055717468

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:55.639
and trying to understand your mindset behind it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.787485659122467

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:58.477
And trying then looking at all the different teams and

NOTE Confidence: 0.787485659122467

00:04:58.526 --> 00:05:01.407
all the different submissions we get to identify, OK, which

NOTE Confidence: 0.787485659122467

00:05:01.456 --> 00:05:04.191
teams have approached this problem in the right way, the

NOTE Confidence: 0.787485659122467

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.679
best way.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8903269171714783

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.810
And so yes, it's a bit of a competitive element

NOTE Confidence: 0.8903269171714783

00:05:07.863 --> 00:05:09.876
to this, but a big part of this is how

NOTE Confidence: 0.8903269171714783

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:13.479
effective you are telling your story around your proposed solution.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9345113039016724

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.082
And just to reiterate, that's not an artificial thing for

NOTE Confidence: 0.9345113039016724

00:05:17.135 --> 00:05:19.399
the concept of this particular competition.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8980704545974731

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:25.428
The ability to communicate and explain your architecture would be

NOTE Confidence: 0.8980704545974731

00:05:25.507 --> 00:05:28.280
key in any scenario in a workplace.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8051769137382507

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.671
Thinking this is the right architecture is only was less

NOTE Confidence: 0.8051769137382507

00:05:31.723 --> 00:05:32.800
than half the battle.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9075109958648682

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.978
The bigger piece then is influencing people around you, explaining

NOTE Confidence: 0.9075109958648682

00:05:37.037 --> 00:05:40.227
your ideas so that your ideas can become battle tested

NOTE Confidence: 0.9075109958648682

00:05:40.286 --> 00:05:43.240
and improved and helping people to implement them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.846656322479248

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.877
So through in today's classes, you're going to learn a

NOTE Confidence: 0.846656322479248

00:05:45.926 --> 00:05:48.661
whole load of new techniques in terms of just practicing

NOTE Confidence: 0.846656322479248

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.689
these ideas, but also getting better at communicating as well

NOTE Confidence: 0.846656322479248

00:05:51.738 --> 00:05:54.620
and thinking of different ways in which you can communicate

NOTE Confidence: 0.846656322479248

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.599
and share the concepts around your architecture in question.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8591260313987732

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:01.198
So what we're going to be doing from each of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8591260313987732

00:06:01.252 --> 00:06:03.932
you is we're going to give you a realistic example

NOTE Confidence: 0.8591260313987732

00:06:03.985 --> 00:06:06.183
of a company and I've made-up a sort of a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8591260313987732

00:06:06.237 --> 00:06:09.399
fake ish company, right, that companies like this do exist.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8602354526519775

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.086
And we're going to ask you to come up with

NOTE Confidence: 0.8602354526519775

00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:15.796
an architecture to solve the challenges this particular company is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8602354526519775

00:06:15.852 --> 00:06:16.240
facing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7905411124229431

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.297
You're going to come back to us a proposal saying

NOTE Confidence: 0.7905411124229431

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:20.879
here's how we think it should be built.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9572628140449524

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.920
We think you should use this technology.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7773340344429016

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.750
We think these services should exist here with the challenging

NOTE Confidence: 0.7773340344429016

00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:29.962
places and we want in this particular cater for you

NOTE Confidence: 0.7773340344429016

00:06:30.024 --> 00:06:33.112
to think carefully about how you would make use of

NOTE Confidence: 0.7773340344429016

00:06:33.174 --> 00:06:33.359
AI.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7276095151901245

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.237
Are there certain parts of this problem space that fit

NOTE Confidence: 0.7276095151901245

00:06:37.302 --> 00:06:37.559
Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8849731683731079

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.920
AI in really effective ways?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8480777144432068

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:43.120
Or maybe there are other areas where you considered the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8480777144432068

00:06:43.172 --> 00:06:45.599
use of AI but decided eventually not to use it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8351588249206543

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.617
So we are going to be looking for you to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8351588249206543

00:06:47.654 --> 00:06:49.040
explain some of your decision making.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7137383222579956

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.400
We'll talk a little bit about AD Rs later on.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83260577917099

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.120
So can you use AI as part of the solution?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9019242525100708

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.160
If so, where?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8471593856811523

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.880
Here's the problem, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8970638513565063

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.360
So what are we building this for?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9233539700508118

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.920
Who is this architecture for?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8450374603271484

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.503
So the system we're going to be looking to build

NOTE Confidence: 0.8450374603271484

00:07:05.548 --> 00:07:07.959
an architecture for is a company called Mobility Corp.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8158825635910034

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:12.304
So Mobility Corp are a company that provides short term

NOTE Confidence: 0.8158825635910034

00:07:12.367 --> 00:07:14.319
rental for last mile transport.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7974206209182739

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.487
I did actually came up with that, you know, kind

NOTE Confidence: 0.7974206209182739

00:07:17.544 --> 00:07:18.640
of tag line myself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7189579010009766

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.840
Feel like I should be in marketing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7383485436439514

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.400
So what does that actually means?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7541022300720215

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.760
It means scooters, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8160545825958252

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.507
It means electric scooters and it means E bikes largely

NOTE Confidence: 0.8160545825958252

00:07:26.572 --> 00:07:27.159
speaking.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8282879590988159

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.448
So you kind of get to public transport a certain

NOTE Confidence: 0.8282879590988159

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:31.101
way and then you want to jump on an E

NOTE Confidence: 0.8282879590988159

00:07:31.144 --> 00:07:33.145
bike, jump on a scooter, get where you need to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8282879590988159

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.320
be.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9598054885864258

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.092
However, we also have a growing fleet of electric cars

NOTE Confidence: 0.9598054885864258

00:07:37.151 --> 00:07:37.679
and vans.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8624802827835083

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.176
The idea of this being a car share based system,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8624802827835083

00:07:40.228 --> 00:07:42.412
you don't have to own your own car or your

NOTE Confidence: 0.8624802827835083

00:07:42.464 --> 00:07:42.880
own van.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8948195576667786

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.653
You could walk to a place nearby your house and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8948195576667786

00:07:45.705 --> 00:07:48.054
get into a car that you've booked, go do your

NOTE Confidence: 0.8948195576667786

00:07:48.107 --> 00:07:49.359
errands, then come back.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8048485517501831

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.901
This is also, this is partly about, you know, it

NOTE Confidence: 0.8048485517501831

00:07:51.943 --> 00:07:54.639
being cheaper for our customers because they don't actually have

NOTE Confidence: 0.8048485517501831

00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:55.440
to own a full car.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9213404059410095

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.281
But also it's better for the planet as well because

NOTE Confidence: 0.9213404059410095

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.456
we can have one car used by loads of people

NOTE Confidence: 0.9213404059410095

00:08:00.506 --> 00:08:03.472
rather than everybody having to build and maintain their own

NOTE Confidence: 0.9213404059410095

00:08:03.522 --> 00:08:03.720
car.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6305937767028809

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.120
So when's the customers?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9461848139762878

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.378
They sign up and then they can rent the available

NOTE Confidence: 0.9461848139762878

00:08:08.425 --> 00:08:08.839
vehicles.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9623440504074097

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.040
And we operate in multiple locations.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7837764620780945

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.867
Mostly we're in city and urban locations and but we're

NOTE Confidence: 0.7837764620780945

00:08:15.935 --> 00:08:18.720
looking to go to more suburban locations.

NOTE Confidence: 0.585240364074707

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.600
It's kind of general context of where we're at.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8650605082511902

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.100
So mostly in cities and large towns, E bikes, scooters,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8650605082511902

00:08:26.191 --> 00:08:27.479
cars and vans.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8293377757072449

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.608
People sign up and they could book a vehicle, go

NOTE Confidence: 0.8293377757072449

00:08:30.654 --> 00:08:32.687
off and drive it and then they have to return

NOTE Confidence: 0.8293377757072449

00:08:32.732 --> 00:08:33.320
that vehicle.

NOTE Confidence: 0.887290358543396

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.167
Now, by the way, as I'm going through all of

NOTE Confidence: 0.887290358543396

00:08:36.217 --> 00:08:38.631
this and I'm outlining the problem, I want all of

NOTE Confidence: 0.887290358543396

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.996
you to be thinking up what questions have I got

NOTE Confidence: 0.887290358543396

00:08:41.045 --> 00:08:41.440
for Sam?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9567233920097351

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.400
This is a great opportunity.

NOTE Confidence: 0.839220404624939

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.492
This kick off session says it's a great opportunity for

NOTE Confidence: 0.839220404624939

00:08:46.549 --> 00:08:49.810
you to ask more questions about Mobility Corps context and

NOTE Confidence: 0.839220404624939

00:08:49.867 --> 00:08:52.959
the business problems that they're trying to deal with.

NOTE Confidence: 0.794715166091919

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.734
So if you do have questions about Mobility's Corp and

NOTE Confidence: 0.794715166091919

00:08:55.776 --> 00:08:58.030
their whole kind of where they're at and the problems

NOTE Confidence: 0.794715166091919

00:08:58.073 --> 00:09:00.625
and the business space, everything else, just put a question

NOTE Confidence: 0.794715166091919

00:09:00.667 --> 00:09:02.922
in that Q&A widget and I'll answer these questions as

NOTE Confidence: 0.794715166091919

00:09:02.964 --> 00:09:03.560
we go through.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8682249188423157

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.067
So you have to come up with an architecture for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8682249188423157

00:09:08.129 --> 00:09:12.080
Mobility Corp incorporating AR functionality where appropriate.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7963352203369141

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.097
So let's talk through kind of overview of how this

NOTE Confidence: 0.7963352203369141

00:09:16.157 --> 00:09:16.519
works.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8117120265960693

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.880
So from a booking point of view, we have kind

NOTE Confidence: 0.8117120265960693

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:21.346
of a bit of a separation between cars and vans

NOTE Confidence: 0.8117120265960693

00:09:21.398 --> 00:09:22.919
and our scooters and E bikes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8982861042022705

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.226
The cars and vans you can book up to seven

NOTE Confidence: 0.8982861042022705

00:09:25.281 --> 00:09:26.159
days in advance.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8962219953536987

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.479
And when you book them, you say how long you're

NOTE Confidence: 0.8962219953536987

00:09:28.521 --> 00:09:29.480
going to book them for.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8689753413200378

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.781
So you'd have to say, I want to book a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8689753413200378

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.888
van, I want to book it for four hours, and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8689753413200378

00:09:33.937 --> 00:09:35.799
then you'll be told where that van is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8713452816009521

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.300
Bikes and scooters can be booked for up to 30

NOTE Confidence: 0.8713452816009521

00:09:39.349 --> 00:09:42.162
minutes in advance, but the booking is open-ended and you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8713452816009521

00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:43.839
can keep them for up to 12 hours.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7476404309272766

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.094
This is much more like the kind of line bike

NOTE Confidence: 0.7476404309272766

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:48.382
situation I'm sure some of you might have for the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7476404309272766

00:09:48.428 --> 00:09:50.946
similar things you might have for Bolt or whatever else

NOTE Confidence: 0.7476404309272766

00:09:50.992 --> 00:09:52.960
where you can go scan AQR code or you could

NOTE Confidence: 0.7476404309272766

00:09:53.006 --> 00:09:55.203
book it in advance, go for a little poodle, drop

NOTE Confidence: 0.7476404309272766

00:09:55.249 --> 00:09:56.759
them off at designated locations.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8887678384780884

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.861
From a payment point of view, you pay per minute

NOTE Confidence: 0.8887678384780884

00:10:00.906 --> 00:10:03.136
for how long you're going to be using these things

NOTE Confidence: 0.8887678384780884

00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:03.360
for.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8910001516342163

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.143
We also apply fines if the vehicles are returned to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8910001516342163

00:10:08.227 --> 00:10:12.240
the wrong location or if they are returned late.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8289147019386292

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.278
So in the case of things like cars and vans,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8289147019386292

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.661
you know, you have a time, the vehicle has to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8289147019386292

00:10:17.713 --> 00:10:20.043
be back at a certain time and after a certain

NOTE Confidence: 0.8289147019386292

00:10:20.095 --> 00:10:21.960
period of time we start finding you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7131774425506592

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.919
And obviously if you looks like you can steal the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7131774425506592

00:10:23.959 --> 00:10:25.919
car, we actually have the ability to kind of, you

NOTE Confidence: 0.7131774425506592

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:27.559
know, track the car and everything else.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8341846466064453

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.381
So we can assume all of these vehicles have GPS

NOTE Confidence: 0.8341846466064453

00:10:30.427 --> 00:10:32.888
trackers on them for the purpose of knowing where they

NOTE Confidence: 0.8341846466064453

00:10:32.934 --> 00:10:33.800
are geographically.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9365675449371338

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.782
And as I mentioned, if things get really bad, we

NOTE Confidence: 0.9365675449371338

00:10:38.853 --> 00:10:41.319
can disable remotely cars and vans.

NOTE Confidence: 0.856501579284668

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.240
Kind of question, is insurance out of scope?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8381882905960083

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.850
You could assume that it is it as much as

NOTE Confidence: 0.8381882905960083

00:10:47.908 --> 00:10:50.319
we kind of as part of the payment we take

NOTE Confidence: 0.8381882905960083

00:10:50.377 --> 00:10:54.081
from customers, we basically kind of insure the vehicles, we've

NOTE Confidence: 0.8381882905960083

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.080
insured the vehicles on our side.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7584158182144165

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.429
So basically assume that insurance is not something you have

NOTE Confidence: 0.7584158182144165

00:11:01.518 --> 00:11:03.479
to worry about and Ms.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8925696611404419

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.240
customers can cancel, that's absolutely fine.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9358866214752197

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.440
So you don't.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7510044574737549

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.077
It wouldn't, I would imagine, change the architecture too much,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7510044574737549

00:11:11.128 --> 00:11:14.159
but customers can cancel basically anytime without penalty.

NOTE Confidence: 0.842872679233551

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:22.400
So the vehicles, all transport vehicles contain GPS trackers.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8594308495521545

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.329
So we know that there they are at all times

NOTE Confidence: 0.8594308495521545

00:11:25.397 --> 00:11:28.600
we can remotely lock and unlock those vehicles.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8840212225914001

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.170
So assume that all of these vehicles have like some

NOTE Confidence: 0.8840212225914001

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:36.580
kind of mechanical device or electronic device that allows for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8840212225914001

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:38.680
remote locking and unlocking.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8159931898117065

00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:41.027
So in the case of the cars and vans, that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8159931898117065

00:11:41.085 --> 00:11:44.177
that stuff has already been installed and that you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.8159931898117065

00:11:44.234 --> 00:11:46.983
assume that you've got some kind of API that you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8159931898117065

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.559
can call to, you know, unlock or lock those.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8279855251312256

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.200
Same goes for the scooters and the E bikes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9191043972969055

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.387
We will assume that when you actually go to unlock

NOTE Confidence: 0.9191043972969055

00:11:58.458 --> 00:12:02.597
these vehicles that our customers have a mobile device that

NOTE Confidence: 0.9191043972969055

00:12:02.667 --> 00:12:03.719
is NFC capable.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8419632315635681

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.524
So in other words, some they have to put their

NOTE Confidence: 0.8419632315635681

00:12:06.583 --> 00:12:09.501
mobile device next to the vehicle to unlock it and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8419632315635681

00:12:09.559 --> 00:12:12.536
that goes for the scooters, the bikes, the vans and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8419632315635681

00:12:12.594 --> 00:12:13.119
the cars.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9258571267127991

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.720
On returning the vehicles they have to the cars and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9258571267127991

00:12:18.784 --> 00:12:22.515
vans, bikes and scooters have to be returned to designated

NOTE Confidence: 0.9258571267127991

00:12:22.579 --> 00:12:23.479
parking spots.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9501752853393555

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.360
So that is important.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8810173869132996

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.240
So and we will also want proof of return.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8825265169143677

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.269
So we expect customers to submit a photo showing where

NOTE Confidence: 0.8825265169143677

00:12:33.343 --> 00:12:35.559
they returned that vehicle to.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8770806193351746

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.727
And then if we have an issue with them, we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8770806193351746

00:12:38.777 --> 00:12:41.614
will then maybe potentially find them if they leave that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8770806193351746

00:12:41.664 --> 00:12:44.096
vehicle in the wrong place with the cars and the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8770806193351746

00:12:44.146 --> 00:12:44.399
vans.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7593142986297607

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.440
We also expect them to be plugged into the EV

NOTE Confidence: 0.7593142986297607

00:12:46.485 --> 00:12:49.160
charger at the destination parking spot when they returned.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7985531091690063

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.970
So we have designated parking bays for these vehicles that

NOTE Confidence: 0.7985531091690063

00:12:53.026 --> 00:12:55.461
we own that EV charges and they have to plug

NOTE Confidence: 0.7985531091690063

00:12:55.517 --> 00:12:55.959
them in.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7874935269355774

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.856
We will also ask the customer to get figures feedback,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7874935269355774

00:13:01.922 --> 00:13:02.319
right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7405959367752075

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.986
So if like the vehicle like they got a bike

NOTE Confidence: 0.7405959367752075

00:13:05.048 --> 00:13:08.086
and the week the, you know, the saddle was wonky,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7405959367752075

00:13:08.148 --> 00:13:08.520
right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9170628786087036

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.166
We would like to know about that so we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.9170628786087036

00:13:10.205 --> 00:13:10.480
fix it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8260091543197632

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.428
Likewise, they go pick up a car, the car's still

NOTE Confidence: 0.8260091543197632

00:13:13.481 --> 00:13:16.082
dirty from the last person who kind of drove that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8260091543197632

00:13:16.135 --> 00:13:16.719
car around.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9435179233551025

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.480
We'd want to know about things like that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7655432224273682

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.960
So bikes and scooters are a bit different.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8537352681159973

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.717
Rather than plugging them into charge up, instead we have

NOTE Confidence: 0.8537352681159973

00:13:28.773 --> 00:13:30.400
swappable batteries for both.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8164515495300293

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.211
So we have a crew that come around that basically

NOTE Confidence: 0.8164515495300293

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.652
pull out sort of flat batteries and plug in fully

NOTE Confidence: 0.8164515495300293

00:13:37.721 --> 00:13:38.960
charged batteries.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8420122265815735

00:13:39.559 --> 00:13:41.662
So we have company staff that will kind of drive

NOTE Confidence: 0.8420122265815735

00:13:41.705 --> 00:13:44.114
around in big vehicles doing this within the area where

NOTE Confidence: 0.8420122265815735

00:13:44.158 --> 00:13:44.639
we operate.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9209194183349609

00:13:45.679 --> 00:13:48.251
So our staff need to know where do we need

NOTE Confidence: 0.9209194183349609

00:13:48.312 --> 00:13:48.679
to go?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8348473906517029

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.542
Where were the vehicles that need to have that, Where

NOTE Confidence: 0.8348473906517029

00:13:51.585 --> 00:13:53.670
are the scooters and the bikes that need to have

NOTE Confidence: 0.8348473906517029

00:13:53.714 --> 00:13:54.799
their batteries replaced.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9203874468803406

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.140
The other part of this is with the bikes and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9203874468803406

00:13:59.193 --> 00:14:01.853
the scooters, which is a bit different to the vans

NOTE Confidence: 0.9203874468803406

00:14:01.907 --> 00:14:04.088
and the cars, is that we want kind of our

NOTE Confidence: 0.9203874468803406

00:14:04.141 --> 00:14:06.588
scooters and our bikes to be a bit more evenly

NOTE Confidence: 0.9203874468803406

00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:07.279
distributed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7845710515975952

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.067
So if everyone jumps, say in London, they'll jump on

NOTE Confidence: 0.7845710515975952

00:14:10.109 --> 00:14:12.174
a bike and they all cycle to Buckingham Palace and

NOTE Confidence: 0.7845710515975952

00:14:12.215 --> 00:14:14.240
then they leave their bikes at Buckingham Palace.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7958242297172546

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.760
We've got no bikes elsewhere.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8461298942565918

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.145
So we also do need to be able to kind

NOTE Confidence: 0.8461298942565918

00:14:18.194 --> 00:14:21.041
of distribute these bikes and these scooters around so that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8461298942565918

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.600
that when people need them, they've got some nearby.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8332618474960327

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.321
So let me talk to some of the business challenges

NOTE Confidence: 0.8332618474960327

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:30.742
and I'm going to run through all the questions that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8332618474960327

00:14:30.788 --> 00:14:31.720
we've had coming in.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7684423327445984

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.840
What are our biggest challenges we've got now?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8736768364906311

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.201
The first thing is we've got customers with our existing

NOTE Confidence: 0.8736768364906311

00:14:39.256 --> 00:14:43.112
system that you're looking to replace our current customers complaining

NOTE Confidence: 0.8736768364906311

00:14:43.167 --> 00:14:45.720
that their vehicles are not in the right place.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8831106424331665

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.671
So they go to get a bike, they go to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8831106424331665

00:14:47.715 --> 00:14:49.439
get a scooter and there isn't 1 nearby.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8579978346824646

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.323
So that's been a bit of an ongoing challenge for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8579978346824646

00:14:51.362 --> 00:14:51.480
us.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9367579817771912

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.593
So we would also like to be able to to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9367579817771912

00:14:54.645 --> 00:14:56.901
know how we put cars and bikes and vans and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9367579817771912

00:14:56.954 --> 00:14:58.999
everything else in the right locations.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9150665402412415

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.784
We sort of want to be able to get a

NOTE Confidence: 0.9150665402412415

00:15:00.824 --> 00:15:02.842
better idea about when they're going to want to use

NOTE Confidence: 0.9150665402412415

00:15:02.882 --> 00:15:03.079
them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.867368757724762

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.891
So it's like, can we as a company work out

NOTE Confidence: 0.867368757724762

00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:08.878
in advance where do we think these things are going

NOTE Confidence: 0.867368757724762

00:15:08.935 --> 00:15:09.280
to be?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9604799747467041

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.680
Where do we need these things to be?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8964076042175293

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.806
To give you a simple example, if somebody was wanting

NOTE Confidence: 0.8964076042175293

00:15:13.862 --> 00:15:16.585
to on their commute home, they might get a train

NOTE Confidence: 0.8964076042175293

00:15:16.642 --> 00:15:17.719
to a local station.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8196613192558289

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.853
They might then want to jump on a bike and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8196613192558289

00:15:19.898 --> 00:15:20.800
cycle to their home.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9083753228187561

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.694
So can we do things like thinking in advance, OK,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9083753228187561

00:15:23.746 --> 00:15:26.216
so we want lots of bikes or scooters near these

NOTE Confidence: 0.9083753228187561

00:15:26.268 --> 00:15:28.159
sort of stations for that to happen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.702802300453186

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.961
And obviously they want to be in different places in

NOTE Confidence: 0.702802300453186

00:15:31.006 --> 00:15:32.480
the morning versus the afternoon.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9174118638038635

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.577
Vans often get used by people at the weekends when

NOTE Confidence: 0.9174118638038635

00:15:35.626 --> 00:15:38.280
they're going to buy furniture from IKEA, for example.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7714475989341736

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.997
So they need to be in different locations at weekends

NOTE Confidence: 0.7714475989341736

00:15:41.044 --> 00:15:42.120
versus during the week.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8797557353973389

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.016
So how can we anticipate how what customers needs might

NOTE Confidence: 0.8797557353973389

00:15:47.082 --> 00:15:47.280
be?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7567138075828552

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.693
Is there other things that we should be taking into

NOTE Confidence: 0.7567138075828552

00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:50.119
account?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8980329036712646

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.082
Does the weather affect which vehicles might want to be

NOTE Confidence: 0.8980329036712646

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:53.960
used for example?

NOTE Confidence: 0.888160228729248

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.792
We also the other issue we sort of have is

NOTE Confidence: 0.888160228729248

00:15:57.842 --> 00:15:59.520
kind of range issues a little bit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8367829918861389

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.250
This has become a, this is less of an issue

NOTE Confidence: 0.8367829918861389

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.941
with the cars and the vans than it is with

NOTE Confidence: 0.8367829918861389

00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:05.200
the bikes and things like that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7333016395568848

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.288
So bikes getting used a lot of running down Laurel

NOTE Confidence: 0.7333016395568848

00:16:08.342 --> 00:16:10.440
and charge before we can swap them out.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7995299100875854

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.306
This is sort of being exacerbated by the bikes and

NOTE Confidence: 0.7995299100875854

00:16:13.354 --> 00:16:15.644
the and the scooters not always being in, in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7995299100875854

00:16:15.692 --> 00:16:17.840
easiest locations for us to go get to them to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7995299100875854

00:16:17.888 --> 00:16:19.319
sort the batteries in and out.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8575936555862427

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.042
So can we prioritize which areas to send our crews

NOTE Confidence: 0.8575936555862427

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:26.799
to, to do the battery swap, for example?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8674550652503967

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.992
So can we prioritize where they need to go, where

NOTE Confidence: 0.8674550652503967

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.000
they need to get to?

NOTE Confidence: 0.792046308517456

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.457
So there's 25 different places where we've got these parking

NOTE Confidence: 0.792046308517456

00:16:35.516 --> 00:16:38.760
bays, which ones they visit first to be most effective.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7856827974319458

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.312
There's certain times of day those those recharge, those battery

NOTE Confidence: 0.7856827974319458

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.040
recharge crews should be going out.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8531094193458557

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.906
The last kind of big business challenge that we've got

NOTE Confidence: 0.8531094193458557

00:16:48.962 --> 00:16:51.261
is that at the moment, most of our use of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8531094193458557

00:16:51.317 --> 00:16:54.120
the existing Mobility Corp system is quite ad hoc.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9591634273529053

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.040
They use it every now and then.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87252277135849

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.076
What we'd ideally like to move towards is a model

NOTE Confidence: 0.87252277135849

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.875
where they're using this as a reliable part of just

NOTE Confidence: 0.87252277135849

00:17:01.928 --> 00:17:03.919
how they travel and how they commute.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8770862817764282

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.883
Part of the concern is that because the vehicles aren't

NOTE Confidence: 0.8770862817764282

00:17:06.923 --> 00:17:09.008
always in the right place and they didn't always have

NOTE Confidence: 0.8770862817764282

00:17:09.047 --> 00:17:11.329
the right vehicle available when they want it, they're not

NOTE Confidence: 0.8770862817764282

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:11.920
relying on us.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8392153978347778

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.660
So we're sort of hoping that if we become more

NOTE Confidence: 0.8392153978347778

00:17:14.712 --> 00:17:18.179
reliable, our vehicles in the right location, they're fully charged

NOTE Confidence: 0.8392153978347778

00:17:18.231 --> 00:17:21.026
up, then people would just start assuming they can use

NOTE Confidence: 0.8392153978347778

00:17:21.078 --> 00:17:23.251
us and be using them more as part of their

NOTE Confidence: 0.8392153978347778

00:17:23.303 --> 00:17:24.079
daily commutes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8017895817756653

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.353
So let me run through a whole bunch of questions

NOTE Confidence: 0.8017895817756653

00:17:28.392 --> 00:17:30.187
that we've got here and you know, some of these

NOTE Confidence: 0.8017895817756653

00:17:30.225 --> 00:17:32.480
questions that I don't think would impact the architecture.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8824273347854614

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.920
So I won't be, I'll just be saying so.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6937698721885681

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:40.286
So RP says does Milibility Corp do business in multiple

NOTE Confidence: 0.6937698721885681

00:17:40.366 --> 00:17:41.159
countries?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8200564980506897

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.999
How about a single country with multiple languages used from

NOTE Confidence: 0.8200564980506897

00:17:46.071 --> 00:17:48.879
Montreal for example, as one regulated?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8910204172134399

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.643
To keep things simple, we're going to assume that you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8910204172134399

00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:55.424
are in just within the EU, but yes, you would

NOTE Confidence: 0.8910204172134399

00:17:55.484 --> 00:17:57.600
have to do with multiple languages.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7824473977088928

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.912
So keep it within the EU to say that you're

NOTE Confidence: 0.7824473977088928

00:17:59.966 --> 00:18:02.386
under GDPR and so you can don't have to worry

NOTE Confidence: 0.7824473977088928

00:18:02.439 --> 00:18:05.236
too much about data location, but yes, that you will

NOTE Confidence: 0.7824473977088928

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.279
have to deal with multiple languages.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9326790571212769

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.560
Next question we had.

NOTE Confidence: 0.724088191986084

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.856
So do we have to take into account consideration legal

NOTE Confidence: 0.724088191986084

00:18:16.913 --> 00:18:18.920
aspects and insurance requirements?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8270180225372314

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.880
Insurance, no.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8690399527549744

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.200
Legality will kind of yes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8074175119400024

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.120
So if someone's stealing a vehicle, how will we know?

NOTE Confidence: 0.849349319934845

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.440
We'll be nice to know about that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8519191741943359

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.297
What happens when a bike doesn't get checked back if

NOTE Confidence: 0.8519191741943359

00:18:29.347 --> 00:18:31.159
somebody's taking it out for a ride?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8185155391693115

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.166
That's maybe not legal, but there's some interesting Gray area

NOTE Confidence: 0.8185155391693115

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:35.119
stuff inside of that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9000552296638489

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.464
The reality is with all of this is that you've

NOTE Confidence: 0.9000552296638489

00:18:37.504 --> 00:18:38.680
got a certain amount of time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6824515461921692

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.320
This is kind of a general piece, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8905685544013977

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.955
Firstly, you don't actually have to rebuild this system for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8905685544013977

00:18:44.003 --> 00:18:44.239
real.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8145267367362976

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:44.640
OK?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8581201434135437

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.119
So getting every single intricate bit of detail out of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8581201434135437

00:18:47.165 --> 00:18:50.150
this isn't necessarily required, given you've probably only got a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8581201434135437

00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:52.400
few weeks to work on this problem in your teams.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9109688401222229

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.961
So I'm going to give you answers to a lot

NOTE Confidence: 0.9109688401222229

00:18:53.998 --> 00:18:56.040
of these questions, but there's only so many things you

NOTE Confidence: 0.9109688401222229

00:18:56.077 --> 00:18:56.559
can focus on.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7907761335372925

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.921
So in those areas where I don't think they're going

NOTE Confidence: 0.7907761335372925

00:18:58.957 --> 00:19:00.396
to be as useful to you in terms of help

NOTE Confidence: 0.7907761335372925

00:19:00.433 --> 00:19:02.166
you solve the Cater, I'm just going to tell you

NOTE Confidence: 0.7907761335372925

00:19:02.203 --> 00:19:02.719
that as we go.

NOTE Confidence: 0.79167240858078

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.657
So I would say from a legal point of view,

NOTE Confidence: 0.79167240858078

00:19:04.703 --> 00:19:07.102
you can kind of assume that that the main regulatory

NOTE Confidence: 0.79167240858078

00:19:07.149 --> 00:19:10.147
restrictions around things like, you know, data location are kind

NOTE Confidence: 0.79167240858078

00:19:10.194 --> 00:19:10.840
of dealt with.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6985766291618347

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.760
You can assume insurance is handled.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7593002319335938

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.120
You can assume this is all legal.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7935173511505127

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.028
The only kind of area where of sort of legality

NOTE Confidence: 0.7935173511505127

00:19:17.076 --> 00:19:19.447
of enforcement you need to deal with is people not

NOTE Confidence: 0.7935173511505127

00:19:19.495 --> 00:19:22.719
returning vehicles to the right location and people stealing things.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8254827857017517

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.280
And that's kind of it, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8299949169158936

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.800
Let's take a look.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7392134070396423

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.896
Can you describe Mobility Corps current capabilities and what product

NOTE Confidence: 0.7392134070396423

00:19:30.937 --> 00:19:32.800
management leadership is saying is important?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6172075867652893

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.621
Because I've just gone through kind of the main the

NOTE Confidence: 0.6172075867652893

00:19:34.655 --> 00:19:35.680
business, business challenges.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8385974168777466

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.076
This slide here outlines the biggest priorities for the business

NOTE Confidence: 0.8385974168777466

00:19:39.129 --> 00:19:42.101
right now for this brand new system that you're creating

NOTE Confidence: 0.8385974168777466

00:19:42.154 --> 00:19:43.800
to replace our existing system.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8015094995498657

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.920
Just assume it's a complete Greenfield rebuild.

NOTE Confidence: 0.806793212890625

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.880
Are there any Geo restrictions, city boundary or similar?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8725400567054749

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.807
There is in terms of where we need vehicles to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8725400567054749

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:55.679
be brought back to.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8903450965881348

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.584
So that's kind of the the location restriction that we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8903450965881348

00:19:59.646 --> 00:19:59.960
have.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7987197041511536

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.526
You can also assume that for the and this also

NOTE Confidence: 0.7987197041511536

00:20:03.589 --> 00:20:06.726
applies in terms of when things be brought back to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7987197041511536

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:07.040
you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8462530374526978

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.280
So things like bikes and scooters can't be left everywhere.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7344560623168945

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.160
There are certain zones where they're allowed to be left.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8124361038208008

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.203
And there are also certain zones where mobility scooters and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8124361038208008

00:20:15.262 --> 00:20:18.961
bikes might be speed limited as well, because certain countries

NOTE Confidence: 0.8124361038208008

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:19.959
in EU need that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6805098652839661

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.482
I found that I was driving through Lap Lithuania and

NOTE Confidence: 0.6805098652839661

00:20:24.553 --> 00:20:26.199
well, I was in Vilnius.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6096010208129883

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.080
I was in Vilnius.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6953495740890503

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.305
I was going along with scooter and then suddenly my

NOTE Confidence: 0.6953495740890503

00:20:29.346 --> 00:20:31.573
scooter went slower because I'd go into the city centre

NOTE Confidence: 0.6953495740890503

00:20:31.614 --> 00:20:33.193
and it said you can't go as fast as you

NOTE Confidence: 0.6953495740890503

00:20:33.234 --> 00:20:33.720
were before.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7740960717201233

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.360
Also, there's a lot of cobbles.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7604536414146423

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:37.406
So the cobbles kind of dealt with that situation for

NOTE Confidence: 0.7604536414146423

00:20:37.446 --> 00:20:37.840
me anyway.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7837111353874207

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.229
Can cars and vans be parked in any parking lots

NOTE Confidence: 0.7837111353874207

00:20:42.301 --> 00:20:43.599
during the rental?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9301029443740845

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.520
Absolutely, yes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8543248176574707

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.367
But when you return it, they have to come back

NOTE Confidence: 0.8543248176574707

00:20:47.429 --> 00:20:50.277
to designated spots for you to kind of say my,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8543248176574707

00:20:50.339 --> 00:20:52.939
you know, I've used up my kind of car hire

NOTE Confidence: 0.8543248176574707

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.910
now or I've finished my rental, they have to be

NOTE Confidence: 0.8543248176574707

00:20:55.972 --> 00:20:57.520
returned to parking bays.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7925840020179749

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.709
Obviously, you might take it out for say a a

NOTE Confidence: 0.7925840020179749

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:02.346
whole day trip, you might park lots of places, that's

NOTE Confidence: 0.7925840020179749

00:21:02.395 --> 00:21:02.640
fine.

NOTE Confidence: 0.895075261592865

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.499
But at the end of your rental, they need to

NOTE Confidence: 0.895075261592865

00:21:05.559 --> 00:21:07.119
come back to certain bays.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6266641020774841

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.040
So that's a question from RL.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9308688640594482

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.320
So thank you for that question as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7462762594223022

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.400
It's about using a third party application like Google Maps.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7748033404350281

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.007
Here Maps, we give you GPS information that you have

NOTE Confidence: 0.7748033404350281

00:21:19.077 --> 00:21:23.239
this hardware in these vehicles that gives you GPS location.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9641653299331665

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.920
So that's what you have available to you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7765511274337769

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.903
Assume you have APIs that allow you to understand where

NOTE Confidence: 0.7765511274337769

00:21:29.971 --> 00:21:31.519
a vehicle currently is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8495547771453857

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.857
So it's up to you to decide what you then

NOTE Confidence: 0.8495547771453857

00:21:33.893 --> 00:21:34.639
want to do with that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7988671064376831

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.081
If you decide HP that you're going to use Google

NOTE Confidence: 0.7988671064376831

00:21:37.132 --> 00:21:39.878
Maps as part of your solution, then you should include

NOTE Confidence: 0.7988671064376831

00:21:39.929 --> 00:21:41.760
that in your answer for the cathode.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8171792030334473

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.720
Explain why and what purpose you're using.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7655143141746521

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.440
This is a just a general part.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8047004342079163

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.426
If there are places here where you have identified maybe

NOTE Confidence: 0.8047004342079163

00:21:48.479 --> 00:21:51.306
third party services that you might use to help solve

NOTE Confidence: 0.8047004342079163

00:21:51.359 --> 00:21:53.279
part of this issue, then include it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8997363448143005

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.873
Explain what you're using, why you're using it, and what

NOTE Confidence: 0.8997363448143005

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.282
part of the solution those things are going to come

NOTE Confidence: 0.8997363448143005

00:21:58.328 --> 00:21:58.560
into.

NOTE Confidence: 0.737633466720581

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.865
So if you want to use Google Maps or here

NOTE Confidence: 0.737633466720581

00:22:00.921 --> 00:22:03.283
Maps HV as part of a solution, let us know

NOTE Confidence: 0.737633466720581

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.240
and tell us why.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8679171204566956

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.320
OK, what else we got here?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6836339235305786

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.255
If it's a daily commuters and people, we parking the

NOTE Confidence: 0.6836339235305786

00:22:11.304 --> 00:22:13.880
vehicles or scooters on their own premise overnight.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8286356329917908

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.839
So you can only rent these things for up to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8286356329917908

00:22:16.891 --> 00:22:17.360
12 hours.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9169417023658752

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.320
You pay for the duration of the rental.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8524602055549622

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.076
Now, obviously if you rent a bike for if you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8524602055549622

00:22:22.126 --> 00:22:24.373
rent like a bike for 12 hours and during that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8524602055549622

00:22:24.423 --> 00:22:26.519
rental, you leave it in your front garden.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8885729312896729

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Well, you've you know you're paying for the rental, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8485473990440369

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.240
So you're still paying for it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7146418690681458

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.246
So it's not being it's only when to return it

NOTE Confidence: 0.7146418690681458

00:22:34.289 --> 00:22:34.760
at the end.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6522658467292786

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.240
It's got to go to certain locations.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6813983917236328

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.567
If the designation is turn spot is not near the

NOTE Confidence: 0.6813983917236328

00:22:41.611 --> 00:22:43.919
customs premise and that can cause logistical change.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8517444729804993

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.640
Yes, it can.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8147495985031128

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.200
That's life.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7532160878181458

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.040
So when you want to return a bike, a scooter,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7532160878181458

00:22:49.095 --> 00:22:52.403
there's certain parking locations where you have to take that

NOTE Confidence: 0.7532160878181458

00:22:52.458 --> 00:22:53.759
bike or scooter back to.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8664265871047974

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.233
And that's actually not something we're fully in control of,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8664265871047974

00:22:57.273 --> 00:22:57.720
by the way.

NOTE Confidence: 0.918899416923523

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.997
That's actually something that cities all across Europe have restrictions

NOTE Confidence: 0.918899416923523

00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:02.399
around.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9082006812095642

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.861
I know that because the other day I was in

NOTE Confidence: 0.9082006812095642

00:23:04.908 --> 00:23:07.078
Denmark two weeks ago and I jumped on a rental

NOTE Confidence: 0.9082006812095642

00:23:07.126 --> 00:23:08.399
bike to cycle to the venue.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8917747735977173

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.216
And then I went to leave the bike at the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8917747735977173

00:23:11.272 --> 00:23:13.655
venue and the app said you've got to put it

NOTE Confidence: 0.8917747735977173

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.315
in the Barking Bay and the parking Bay that was

NOTE Confidence: 0.8917747735977173

00:23:16.371 --> 00:23:18.199
available to me was further away.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6813379526138306

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.857
The word actually when you pick the bike up, this

NOTE Confidence: 0.6813379526138306

00:23:20.904 --> 00:23:21.279
happens.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9154778122901917

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.181
So what will be useful is when I rent a

NOTE Confidence: 0.9154778122901917

00:23:24.244 --> 00:23:26.895
bike, if I say where I'm going to, if your

NOTE Confidence: 0.9154778122901917

00:23:26.958 --> 00:23:29.924
solution says ah, and you can drop the bike off

NOTE Confidence: 0.9154778122901917

00:23:29.987 --> 00:23:33.079
at this location and maybe help the customer out.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8278992772102356

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.809
Because all I can say is Uber really screwed me

NOTE Confidence: 0.8278992772102356

00:23:35.867 --> 00:23:38.539
over when I was in Copenhagen two weeks ago on

NOTE Confidence: 0.8278992772102356

00:23:38.597 --> 00:23:39.119
that one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7887257933616638

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.040
So that is just life to an extent.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8640427589416504

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.486
And that is often the rule the we have to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8640427589416504

00:23:44.546 --> 00:23:47.829
clear things with the cities that we're operating in to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8640427589416504

00:23:47.888 --> 00:23:49.560
get the licenses to operate.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8651283383369446

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.160
And they place restrictions on us.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7008312940597534

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.208
You can't go in these locations, speed limited here, you

NOTE Confidence: 0.7008312940597534

00:23:54.256 --> 00:23:55.840
can only park in these locations.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795086145401001

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.197
So that is to an extent, slightly out of our

NOTE Confidence: 0.795086145401001

00:23:58.251 --> 00:23:58.679
control.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8791094422340393

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.513
How do you plan on handing vehicles being out of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8791094422340393

00:24:04.574 --> 00:24:06.760
charge on the road before returning?

NOTE Confidence: 0.907890796661377

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.433
So in the case of bikes and scooters, they still

NOTE Confidence: 0.907890796661377

00:24:09.483 --> 00:24:10.880
work if we're out of charge.

NOTE Confidence: 0.737069308757782

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.331
And at that point we would just alert them they

NOTE Confidence: 0.737069308757782

00:24:13.363 --> 00:24:15.045
should, they're going to be out of charge and they're

NOTE Confidence: 0.737069308757782

00:24:15.076 --> 00:24:16.441
just going to have to get back to a parking

NOTE Confidence: 0.737069308757782

00:24:16.473 --> 00:24:16.599
Bay.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9190005660057068

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.923
In the case of cars or vans, we probably should

NOTE Confidence: 0.9190005660057068

00:24:19.984 --> 00:24:22.684
not allow the booking to go ahead if the car

NOTE Confidence: 0.9190005660057068

00:24:22.745 --> 00:24:26.119
doesn't have enough charge, if that makes sense, right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7747038006782532

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.939
So when you return a vehicle, you have to plug

NOTE Confidence: 0.7747038006782532

00:24:28.992 --> 00:24:31.237
it into one of our EV charges, which is in

NOTE Confidence: 0.7747038006782532

00:24:31.291 --> 00:24:32.199
the parking base.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8526157140731812

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.520
You have to do that before you can say this

NOTE Confidence: 0.8526157140731812

00:24:34.573 --> 00:24:36.959
parking, this is now big parking is finished.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8553959131240845

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.200
So that should deal with charging between those things.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7994122505187988

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.074
But if you say you're going to go pick a

NOTE Confidence: 0.7994122505187988

00:24:43.115 --> 00:24:45.035
vehicle up and you've booked in for say 8 hours

NOTE Confidence: 0.7994122505187988

00:24:45.076 --> 00:24:47.078
worth of driving and there's like 10% left in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7994122505187988

00:24:47.118 --> 00:24:49.079
battery, we shouldn't go ahead with that charge.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8343921303749084

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.964
In the worst case where somebody absolutely, you know, kind

NOTE Confidence: 0.8343921303749084

00:24:53.022 --> 00:24:55.388

NOTE Confidence: 0.8343921303749084

00:24:55.446 --> 00:24:58.158
run out of charge during that stay, then we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.8343921303749084

00:24:58.216 --> 00:25:00.639
have a, we have a recovery fleet for that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7705914974212646

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.621
We do also give them, they can actually use with

NOTE Confidence: 0.7705914974212646

00:25:09.117 --> 00:25:09.520
right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.819743275642395

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.364
That little mobile app with the NFC chip, they can

NOTE Confidence: 0.819743275642395

00:25:12.421 --> 00:25:14.924
actually go and if they want to pay for more

NOTE Confidence: 0.819743275642395

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.995
energy top up during their rental, like the EV charge

NOTE Confidence: 0.819743275642395

00:25:18.052 --> 00:25:21.352
stations that we the best networks in different cities and

NOTE Confidence: 0.819743275642395

00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:23.400
we do charge them for that as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7475787997245789

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.535
So they can top up like their top up, you

NOTE Confidence: 0.7475787997245789

00:25:25.583 --> 00:25:28.039
know, paying for petrol when you take a car rental.

NOTE Confidence: 0.947290301322937

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.131
How many total customers and how many rentals on average

NOTE Confidence: 0.947290301322937

00:25:33.192 --> 00:25:33.679
per day?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8586873412132263

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.400
Do you know what?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8526549339294434

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.440
I haven't made-up a number around that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7705994248390198

Ms.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8072320818901062

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.156
Assume whatever the numbers we're operating in right now are

NOTE Confidence: 0.8072320818901062

00:25:42.213 --> 00:25:45.157
going up, assume it all across Europe and that we're

NOTE Confidence: 0.8072320818901062

00:25:45.214 --> 00:25:46.120
looking to grow.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9270116686820984

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.080
I don't have hard numbers on that, though.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8942078948020935

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:54.680
Do you know what I'm going to say we're operating.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8022777438163757

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:55.600
Do you know what?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8318980932235718

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.308
I'm going to make some numbers up now and I'm

NOTE Confidence: 0.8318980932235718

00:25:57.346 --> 00:25:59.319
going to write them down so that everybody has them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8424118161201477

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.269
We're operating in every country right now in the EU

NOTE Confidence: 0.8424118161201477

00:26:04.355 --> 00:26:07.880
and we operate in each country in the EU.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8126083016395569

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:12.537
We've got 5000 bikes, 5000 scooters and a couple of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8126083016395569

00:26:12.628 --> 00:26:16.646
100 cars and a couple of 100 vans, 200 vans,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8126083016395569

00:26:16.738 --> 00:26:17.559
200 cars.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75804203748703

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.508
I'm just writing this down now, so I'm this is

NOTE Confidence: 0.75804203748703

00:26:20.559 --> 00:26:22.039
me being creative on the fly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7774796485900879

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.121
So do you do bear with me, let's put that

NOTE Confidence: 0.7774796485900879

00:26:26.221 --> 00:26:26.519
in.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8525398969650269

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:32.534
So I'm going to write this down to 200 cars,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8525398969650269

00:26:32.671 --> 00:26:38.959
200 bikes, 5K in terms of 5K scooters, and 5K.

NOTE Confidence: 0.927680253982544

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.800
Bikes in each country, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8251282572746277

00:26:49.119 --> 00:26:52.284
And so that's just the numbers of vehicles that we've

NOTE Confidence: 0.8251282572746277

00:26:52.343 --> 00:26:53.119
got going on.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8370541930198669

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.360
Do we consider subscriptions?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9388810992240906

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.421
It's not a main focus for us at the moment

NOTE Confidence: 0.9388810992240906

00:27:00.473 --> 00:27:02.240
because we don't know necessarily.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7994154095649719

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.251
I mean that that's it's not an important part of

NOTE Confidence: 0.7994154095649719

00:27:04.293 --> 00:27:06.681
the solution because if people can have a subscription or

NOTE Confidence: 0.7994154095649719

00:27:06.723 --> 00:27:08.735
what's really going to do is change how much you

NOTE Confidence: 0.7994154095649719

00:27:08.777 --> 00:27:09.280
charge them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8396080732345581

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.128
So unless you feel that the subscription model would materially

NOTE Confidence: 0.8396080732345581

00:27:13.177 --> 00:27:16.560
impact our business challenges and would change the architecture, but

NOTE Confidence: 0.8396080732345581

00:27:16.609 --> 00:27:19.207
it's not something we're over be worried about at the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8396080732345581

00:27:19.256 --> 00:27:19.599
moment.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7593843340873718

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.520
Are you planning to scale up?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8396415710449219

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.680
Yes, we always want more people.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8606188893318176

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.080
We would like our vehicles to be used more effectively.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9423778057098389

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.874
So a lot of our capital investment is in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9423778057098389

00:27:30.929 --> 00:27:31.799
vehicles, right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7303731441497803

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.031
So we've paid the money and there's ongoing costs, just

NOTE Confidence: 0.7303731441497803

00:27:35.088 --> 00:27:35.880
maintain them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8841519355773926

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.894
We would like more of our vehicles to be used

NOTE Confidence: 0.8841519355773926

00:27:38.953 --> 00:27:41.588
more often before we add to our fleet and at

NOTE Confidence: 0.8841519355773926

00:27:41.648 --> 00:27:44.581
the moment vehicles are in the wrong place at the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8841519355773926

00:27:44.641 --> 00:27:45.360
wrong times.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7675383687019348

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.300
So the moment we put the money into buying the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7675383687019348

00:27:48.353 --> 00:27:50.439
vehicles we want to get them used more.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8752305507659912

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.154
So we are looking to scale up, but think more

NOTE Confidence: 0.8752305507659912

00:27:53.203 --> 00:27:55.641
in terms of the vehicles we've got being used more

NOTE Confidence: 0.8752305507659912

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:58.080
frequently rather than buying lots more vehicles.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7009273767471313

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.119
KSS is there a maximum number of kilos for the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7009273767471313

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.279
scooters and the vans?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9283301830291748

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.799
So for the bikes and the scooters, there is no

NOTE Confidence: 0.9283301830291748

00:28:07.871 --> 00:28:09.439
effective upper limit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8913440704345703

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.531
Assume that any point you can find out what the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8913440704345703

00:28:13.612 --> 00:28:15.640
range is on an EV charge.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8257162570953369

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.101
Remember that the scooters and the bikes still operate even

NOTE Confidence: 0.8257162570953369

00:28:19.154 --> 00:28:21.519
without a charge, they're just not as useful.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7768535614013672

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.066
Fans and cars obviously stop operating when you run out

00:28:30.116 --> 00:28:34.277
time you can find out what is the remaining range

NOTE Confidence: 0.892977774143219

00:28:34.362 --> 00:28:37.080
of any of the vehicles, DZ said.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7477473020553589

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.040
Is it permitted to cross country border?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8202166557312012

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.057
Some countries are doing that, DZ said if you stay

NOTE Confidence: 0.8202166557312012

00:28:43.129 --> 00:28:46.420
within the EU and you have to return the bike,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8202166557312012

00:28:46.492 --> 00:28:50.284
vehicle, whatever to the place where you got it from,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8202166557312012

00:28:50.356 --> 00:28:52.359
then we don't actually care.

NOTE Confidence: 0.872061014175415

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.393
So in terms of crossing boundaries or not, that's to

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.119
be covered off there as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6521221399307251

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.080
So RSS.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8713629245758057

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.600
Isn't a one way trip rental a good idea?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8457056283950806

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.628
The customer should pay a fee for not returning to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8457056283950806

00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:08.400
the original base.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8517647981643677

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.975
So there were a couple of you here actually suggesting

NOTE Confidence: 0.8517647981643677

00:29:11.016 --> 00:29:13.071
sort of changing the business model a little bit to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8517647981643677

00:29:13.111 --> 00:29:14.280
solve some of these problems.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9309762716293335

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.200
Do you know what?

NOTE Confidence: 0.886303186416626

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.635
If you want to propose as part of your solution

NOTE Confidence: 0.886303186416626

00:29:17.686 --> 00:29:20.437
that there were changes to the business model to solve

NOTE Confidence: 0.886303186416626

00:29:20.488 --> 00:29:22.680
some of these issues, please do suggest it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7078176140785217

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.280
So Rs here was saying why don't we change thing?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7762863039970398

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.379
We have a one way trip they and they pay

NOTE Confidence: 0.7762863039970398

00:29:28.431 --> 00:29:30.793
a fee if they don't return the vehicle to the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7762863039970398

00:29:30.845 --> 00:29:32.000
original base station.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8890917897224426

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.573
I mean, effectively that's kind of what we do right

NOTE Confidence: 0.8890917897224426

00:29:35.621 --> 00:29:36.920
now is you don't pay extra.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8271164894104004

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.032
So maybe you want to suggest that they get money

NOTE Confidence: 0.8271164894104004

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.199
off if they return it to the original place.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8717904090881348

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:46.287
Or maybe Rs, we incentivize you to leave it at

NOTE Confidence: 0.8717904090881348

00:29:46.375 --> 00:29:47.959
certain locations.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8942229151725769

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.920
So for example, there's 20 parking bays.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899250864982605

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.847
If you leave it at these three parking bays, maybe

NOTE Confidence: 0.899250864982605

00:29:53.898 --> 00:29:55.079
we give you a discount.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7415921688079834

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.080
Now these parking bays we don't.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8562365770339966

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.878
So if that's kind of part of your solution, Rs,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8562365770339966

00:29:59.926 --> 00:30:01.719
then maybe put that into your answer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.813221275806427

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.040
But I like that idea.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8899823427200317

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:10.441
OK, So are you targeting high end customers or all

NOTE Confidence: 0.8899823427200317

00:30:10.543 --> 00:30:11.560
customers?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7785501480102539

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.913
HV high end customers tend to not want to, you

NOTE Confidence: 0.7785501480102539

00:30:15.987 --> 00:30:18.200
tend to buy things themselves.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9254955053329468

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.587
So I I would say we are targeting people that

NOTE Confidence: 0.9254955053329468

00:30:21.655 --> 00:30:24.859
don't want to own their own vehicles or are not

NOTE Confidence: 0.9254955053329468

00:30:24.927 --> 00:30:28.200
in a position to bring those vehicles with them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.922438383102417

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.282
So think about somebody coming from out of town into

NOTE Confidence: 0.922438383102417

00:30:31.332 --> 00:30:33.670
a large city like London or Berlin for the day

NOTE Confidence: 0.922438383102417

00:30:33.721 --> 00:30:36.160
and they're like, do I bring my vehicle with me?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7853066325187683

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.440
I don't want to have to travel in.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9098773002624512

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.618
So I might be quite wealthy, but I've taken a

NOTE Confidence: 0.9098773002624512

00:30:40.684 --> 00:30:41.279
training.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8315617442131042

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.244
So it's nice and convenient to me for people living

NOTE Confidence: 0.8315617442131042

00:30:44.302 --> 00:30:45.000
in the city.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7120029330253601

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.422
So you don't don't have the space to drive these

NOTE Confidence: 0.7120029330253601

00:30:47.472 --> 00:30:48.280
vehicles around.

NOTE Confidence: 0.923800528049469

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.500
So it's it's not don't think in terms of high

NOTE Confidence: 0.923800528049469

00:30:51.562 --> 00:30:52.440
end customers.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9298699498176575

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.608
Think purely in terms of this is for people who

NOTE Confidence: 0.9298699498176575

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:57.122
want the vehicles where they want them rather than carrying

NOTE Confidence: 0.9298699498176575

00:30:57.164 --> 00:30:57.960
vehicles with them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8069888353347778

00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.560
So it's not necessary.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8219765424728394

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:04.149
If this would cut across I would imagine quite a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8219765424728394

00:31:04.244 --> 00:31:07.399
lot of socio economic groups can.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7559652328491211

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.480
Should a user extend a car rental?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7835215926170349

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.800
A car or a van rental during the rental?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9680708646774292

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.560
Yes, if possible.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7903178334236145

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.681
So if they booked it for four hours and they're

NOTE Confidence: 0.7903178334236145

00:31:16.737 --> 00:31:19.615
they realize we'll extend it, they should be able to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7903178334236145

00:31:19.671 --> 00:31:20.280
request it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9328591823577881

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.079
But if we need the vehicle back, we need the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9328591823577881

00:31:22.119 --> 00:31:22.639
vehicle back.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6801507472991943

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:30.160
There's no guarantees but a question here from LJ.

NOTE Confidence: 0.935683012008667

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.528
What is the interface to get the data out of

NOTE Confidence: 0.935683012008667

00:31:33.604 --> 00:31:34.600
the vehicles?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8747009038925171

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.265
Do you know what I'm going to say is I'm

NOTE Confidence: 0.8747009038925171

00:31:36.301 --> 00:31:38.280
going to let you define what that interface should be.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8377602696418762

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.357
So LJ was saying should the interface with the vehicles

NOTE Confidence: 0.8377602696418762

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:42.920
be HTTP?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8102691769599915

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.800
Should it be MQTT?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8630322217941284

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.363
Actually, I am very happy for you to to decide

NOTE Confidence: 0.8630322217941284

00:31:48.429 --> 00:31:50.479
how that interface should work.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8636260628700256

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.179
So I'm going to let you this, the equipment is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8636260628700256

00:31:53.223 --> 00:31:55.199
going to be in a vehicle that's going to give

NOTE Confidence: 0.8636260628700256

00:31:55.243 --> 00:31:57.351
you the capability to know what is the range and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8636260628700256

00:31:57.395 --> 00:31:59.546
to lock and unlock the vehicle and get other kind

NOTE Confidence: 0.8636260628700256

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.873
of telemetry information out of it, like where it is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8636260628700256

00:32:01.917 --> 00:32:02.839
and things like that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8848652839660645

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.323
And then I want you to tell us what that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8848652839660645

00:32:05.375 --> 00:32:07.719
interface should be as part of your solution.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8027020692825317

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:13.677
OK, so I'm just putting these notes down so I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8027020692825317

00:32:13.803 --> 00:32:18.940
can remember to play them back next time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7596744298934937

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:24.268
So great question, LJ SI said, Do we have any

NOTE Confidence: 0.7596744298934937

00:32:24.366 --> 00:32:27.600
windows of booking a vehicle yet?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7944827675819397

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.143
So you can book a car or a van up

NOTE Confidence: 0.7944827675819397

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.359
to seven days in advance.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8526722192764282

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.579
A scooter or a bike you can book up to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8526722192764282

00:32:32.634 --> 00:32:35.451
30 minutes in advance for cars or with for scooters

NOTE Confidence: 0.8526722192764282

00:32:35.506 --> 00:32:38.323
and bikes when you book them 30 minutes in advance,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8526722192764282

00:32:38.379 --> 00:32:40.920
you start paying for the moment you book them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7985438108444214

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.690
So like if I say I've reserved a bike, it's

NOTE Confidence: 0.7985438108444214

00:32:43.734 --> 00:32:46.064
waiting for me at the station, I'm already paying for

NOTE Confidence: 0.7985438108444214

00:32:46.108 --> 00:32:46.240
it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6752498745918274

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.795
Whereas cars and vans you don't actually isn't actually start

NOTE Confidence: 0.6752498745918274

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:52.710
charging until you hit that sort of you know, that's

NOTE Confidence: 0.6752498745918274

00:32:52.765 --> 00:32:55.240
that charge start time, how payments handled.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8371270895004272

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.362
What if a credit card runs out of funds before

NOTE Confidence: 0.8371270895004272

00:32:57.407 --> 00:32:58.719
a customer returns a vehicle?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7410323619842529

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.760
We do pre authorization for payments.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8659211993217468

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.520
So when you rent a bike, we will pre authorize

NOTE Confidence: 0.8659211993217468

00:33:03.575 --> 00:33:05.000
a certain amount of money.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7967905402183533

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.703
I looking through the questions, someone says it doesn't fit

NOTE Confidence: 0.7967905402183533

00:33:09.759 --> 00:33:11.000
like a business model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.761172354221344

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.032
Say this daily commute doesn't look like it would fit

NOTE Confidence: 0.761172354221344

00:33:14.084 --> 00:33:15.559
in with this business model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8129398226737976

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.210
Well, then if you've got suggestions about how the business

NOTE Confidence: 0.8129398226737976

00:33:18.243 --> 00:33:19.945
model should change, you might want to pay that back

NOTE Confidence: 0.8129398226737976

00:33:19.978 --> 00:33:20.239
as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.724554717540741

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.360
Just remember thinking about this is a catter, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7331603169441223

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.340
So the purpose of a catter is you to practice

NOTE Confidence: 0.7331603169441223

00:33:26.406 --> 00:33:27.400
certain things.

NOTE Confidence: 0.886462926864624

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.876
So if you want to spend your time coming up

NOTE Confidence: 0.886462926864624

00:33:29.921 --> 00:33:32.327
with a Better Business model for this and that's where

NOTE Confidence: 0.886462926864624

00:33:32.372 --> 00:33:34.199
you want to spend your time, that's fine.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7473117709159851

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.536
But as we'll get on to in a minute, those

NOTE Confidence: 0.7473117709159851

00:33:36.584 --> 00:33:39.767
aren't necessarily the judging criteria we're going to be focusing

NOTE Confidence: 0.7473117709159851

00:33:39.815 --> 00:33:39.959
on.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7948060035705566

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.952
So given the time available to you, there's going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7948060035705566

00:33:42.998 --> 00:33:45.390
be certain things you're going to want to focus your

NOTE Confidence: 0.7948060035705566

00:33:45.436 --> 00:33:47.414
time on to kind of based on the things that

NOTE Confidence: 0.7948060035705566

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.840
we are going to be looking at.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8115462064743042

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.989
I'll take you through the judging criteria in just a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8115462064743042

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:51.320
minute.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8920303583145142

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.880
OK, I think I've answered all the other questions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7758257389068604

00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.200
How about if car or bikes are broken mid journey?

NOTE Confidence: 0.3835538327693939

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.240
Do we tell these cases?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6841210722923279

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:01.640
Yes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7349697947502136

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.770
If things breakdown, you have to have a way of

NOTE Confidence: 0.7349697947502136

00:34:03.812 --> 00:34:04.399
handling that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8299415111541748

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.160
So what do you do in those situations?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7623850107192993

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.520
How do we handle those situations?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8151649236679077

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.640
Yeah, we have to handle that use case as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6918522715568542

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.721
So people can drive as far as along as long

NOTE Confidence: 0.6918522715568542

00:34:16.764 --> 00:34:18.519
as they bring the vehicles back, correct.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7238394021987915

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.707
Does that mean we have to have strategy to distribute

NOTE Confidence: 0.7238394021987915

00:34:20.738 --> 00:34:22.405
the vehicles in the right location during the days of

NOTE Confidence: 0.7238394021987915

00:34:22.436 --> 00:34:22.720
the week?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9288977384567261

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:23.840
Absolutely.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8842261433601379

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.506
In fact, that's our number one biggest challenge at the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8842261433601379

00:34:26.554 --> 00:34:29.075
moment is our bikes and vehicles aren't in the right

NOTE Confidence: 0.8842261433601379

00:34:29.123 --> 00:34:29.559
location.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7846372127532959

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.800
So we absolutely need to do that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6742847561836243

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.129
Is there historical data available that can be used to

NOTE Confidence: 0.6742847561836243

00:34:34.178 --> 00:34:36.240
predict peak demands on certain locations?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8556283116340637

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.244
You could assume we've already got data about how our

NOTE Confidence: 0.8556283116340637

00:34:39.294 --> 00:34:41.440
old system has been operating historically.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8720280528068542

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.328
You are going to be building a replacement system, so

NOTE Confidence: 0.8720280528068542

00:34:44.375 --> 00:34:46.628
you might want to think about how we're going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8720280528068542

00:34:46.675 --> 00:34:49.774
cut that information going forward and what information would need

NOTE Confidence: 0.8720280528068542

00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:51.840
to collect to be able to do forecasting Rd.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7994176149368286

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.440
But great question, so thank you for that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.708667516708374

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.464
So some other question, when we say vans, do we

NOTE Confidence: 0.708667516708374

00:35:01.532 --> 00:35:04.040
assume their cargo or for passengers?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8516727089881897

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.659
So for vans, you can assume that you've got the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8516727089881897

00:35:06.709 --> 00:35:09.396
space of two or three people, but they're mostly about

NOTE Confidence: 0.8516727089881897

00:35:09.446 --> 00:35:10.840
carrying around large items.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6364072561264038

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.617
They're they're going and bike to IKEA and buying flat

NOTE Confidence: 0.6364072561264038

00:35:13.668 --> 00:35:14.439
pack furniture.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8720267415046692

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.257
So to elaborate on the question of handling out of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8720267415046692

00:35:21.314 --> 00:35:24.685
charge, can they be swapped in in an appropriate designated

NOTE Confidence: 0.8720267415046692

00:35:24.742 --> 00:35:26.800
location for the bikes and scooters?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8470433354377747

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.987
It's just a simple pull out, put it in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8470433354377747

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.071
back of a van, pull out and put it back

NOTE Confidence: 0.8470433354377747

00:35:31.123 --> 00:35:31.280
in.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6532261967658997

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.200
So that's can be swapped.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7204362750053406

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.320
Actually on silent Streets doesn't need any special locations.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7629509568214417

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.089
We have like a special device to open the battery

NOTE Confidence: 0.7629509568214417

00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:40.379
out, take the whole battery out and stop them in

NOTE Confidence: 0.7629509568214417

00:35:40.426 --> 00:35:40.800
and out.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8137491941452026

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.000
It's a very quick thing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8028537631034851

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.163
There's been engineers to be done on the side of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8028537631034851

00:35:44.205 --> 00:35:45.040
the road if need be.

NOTE Confidence: 0.725773811340332

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:52.320
OK, yes, I've answered that question as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9385761022567749

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.840
How do I as a customer, how do I book?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9244494438171387

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:58.880
You have an app.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8617083430290222

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.760
So you as a customer have an app.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8812856674194336

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.681
So you have a mobile app that you can use

NOTE Confidence: 0.8812856674194336

00:36:03.742 --> 00:36:05.800
to say I want to car at this time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7916273474693298

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.533
Let me go through a few more questions, loads of

NOTE Confidence: 0.7916273474693298

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.160
questions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5385090112686157

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:11.640
This is great.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7836815118789673

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.718
OK, so someone says what about trip sharing options required

NOTE Confidence: 0.7836815118789673

00:36:19.766 --> 00:36:21.279
taking routes to pick up people.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9415338635444641

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.680
If you're talking about planning routes to pick people up,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9415338635444641

00:36:24.733 --> 00:36:27.441
that's more into just using Google Maps, get from A

NOTE Confidence: 0.9415338635444641

00:36:27.494 --> 00:36:27.760
to B.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8969744443893433

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.560
We're just renting you the vehicle.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8718491196632385

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.672
What you then do with the vehicle is kind of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8718491196632385

00:36:31.717 --> 00:36:34.072
up to you unless there's things that you feel should

NOTE Confidence: 0.8718491196632385

00:36:34.117 --> 00:36:36.019
be built into the app to help us solve our

NOTE Confidence: 0.8718491196632385

00:36:36.064 --> 00:36:36.879
business problems.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7653365135192871

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.040
Google Maps and ways, everything else still exists, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7892794609069824

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.266
So if you want to use that for planning how

NOTE Confidence: 0.7892794609069824

00:36:42.318 --> 00:36:44.545
you get from point A to P, that's on that's

NOTE Confidence: 0.7892794609069824

00:36:44.597 --> 00:36:44.959
on you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6742925643920898

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.000
But not let's say something is in scope for us.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8040788769721985

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.560
Should we have customers ratings to provide service or offers?

NOTE Confidence: 0.5842681527137756

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.640
We have customer ratings provide service or offers.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7141244411468506

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.388
Not really important for this business case for what we

NOTE Confidence: 0.7141244411468506

00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.640
want to focus on today.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6976803541183472

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.212
Is there an expectation about taking a vehicle outside a

NOTE Confidence: 0.6976803541183472

00:37:05.271 --> 00:37:06.799
cell mobile service range?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7925159931182861

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:11.413
We use GPS devices for tracking the location, so it's

NOTE Confidence: 0.7925159931182861

00:37:11.491 --> 00:37:15.079
not dependent on cellular signals necessarily.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8460833430290222

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.019
Obviously if you feel like the vehicles vanished from signal

NOTE Confidence: 0.8460833430290222

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.476
because some stuck in the back of containers being stolen,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8460833430290222

00:37:20.518 --> 00:37:21.560
we might care about that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9522464275360107

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.883
At the moment, theft of vehicles is not a major

NOTE Confidence: 0.9522464275360107

00:37:25.968 --> 00:37:26.480
issue.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7947589159011841

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.558
We feel that we've got that highly dealt, well dealt

NOTE Confidence: 0.7947589159011841

00:37:29.605 --> 00:37:29.840
with.

NOTE Confidence: 0.869886040687561

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.959
So only spend time worrying about vehicle theft if you

NOTE Confidence: 0.869886040687561

00:37:33.013 --> 00:37:35.679
feel like you solve these other business problems.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8767762780189514

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.240
So LJ says, do you have any suggestion on the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8767762780189514

00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:46.440
communication frequency of the telemetry from the vehicle?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8449782729148865

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.523
This will help us know the accuracy of the GPS

NOTE Confidence: 0.8449782729148865

00:37:49.585 --> 00:37:53.418
communication sampling rate on the frequency of the data being

NOTE Confidence: 0.8449782729148865

00:37:53.479 --> 00:37:54.839
sent from the vehicle.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8525248765945435

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:59.103
Assume you get sent of a sample at least every

NOTE Confidence: 0.8525248765945435

00:37:59.184 --> 00:38:00.079
30 seconds.

NOTE Confidence: 0.896972119808197

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:07.375
OK, Now if you feel that that isn't appropriate, explain

NOTE Confidence: 0.896972119808197

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:13.370
why I'm going to let you change that frequency, LJ.

NOTE Confidence: 0.857925295829773

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:15.290
So if you want to think we should be getting

NOTE Confidence: 0.857925295829773

00:38:15.333 --> 00:38:17.769
frequencies more frequently, let us know and explain why.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8534324169158936

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:20.572
There's a cost of doing that of course, in terms

NOTE Confidence: 0.8534324169158936

00:38:20.623 --> 00:38:23.371
of energy consumption and the data ingest, but you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.8534324169158936

00:38:23.422 --> 00:38:25.559
assume probably at least every 30 seconds.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8790740370750427

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.455
Is it possible to specify booking starting time to some

NOTE Confidence: 0.8790740370750427

00:38:30.516 --> 00:38:33.669
external extent, like book me a car 30 minutes after

NOTE Confidence: 0.8790740370750427

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:34.639
BA38 will land?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8593392968177795

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.200
No, you have to book a certain time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8877684473991394

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.600
We can't be dependent on BA flight delays.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8610144257545471

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.305
Does every team member have to have an active arrival

NOTE Confidence: 0.8610144257545471

00:38:45.359 --> 00:38:47.359

NOTE Confidence: 0.8841375708580017

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.640
I leave that question to Joan.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7005715370178223

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.200
So this is for when you do submissions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7290786504745483

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.000
I'll take you how that works in just a moment.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7999173402786255

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.999
I don't, I think it, I think Joan can answer

NOTE Confidence: 0.7999173402786255

00:38:59.054 --> 00:39:00.799
that question better than I can.

NOTE Confidence: 0.770534098148346

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.266
Is it possible to communicate with the people in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.770534098148346

00:39:04.333 --> 00:39:05.799
vehicle independently?

NOTE Confidence: 0.3955668807029724

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.200
Mobile device?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7471524477005005

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.880
No communication is done by them, by the mobile app.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9271737933158875

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.240
We have a phone number for them as well, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.814412534236908

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.880
So we can phone them if it happens.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8328980207443237

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.960
Do you pay per minute or per mile?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9070900082588196

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.120
You pay based on time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7749918699264526

00:39:16.719 --> 00:39:20.374
You pay based on time, not on duration, say trip

NOTE Confidence: 0.7749918699264526

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:24.181
sharing to share cost of people going in the same

NOTE Confidence: 0.7749918699264526

00:39:24.257 --> 00:39:29.130
direction, especially when people choose a service for more, for

NOTE Confidence: 0.7749918699264526

00:39:29.206 --> 00:39:32.480
more forensic again, not it's out of scope.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8946908116340637

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.120
It's not something we're focusing on right now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5333248376846313

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:34.520
PV.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8757516741752625

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.240
So those were loads of great questions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8672919869422913

00:39:37.239 --> 00:39:39.241
I just want to add on a cup just to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8672919869422913

00:39:39.298 --> 00:39:42.785
reiterate a couple of things that I've clarified that weren't

NOTE Confidence: 0.8672919869422913

00:39:42.843 --> 00:39:45.301

NOTE Confidence: 0.8672919869422913

00:39:45.358 --> 00:39:47.360
vehicles we've got in our location.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8599340319633484

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.520
We're in the EU.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9403515458106995

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:52.120
We're operating across the European Union only at the moment.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9374905824661255

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.720
That means we are not currently in the UK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7536324858665466

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.009
Whether we're in Northern Ireland depends on your definition of

NOTE Confidence: 0.7536324858665466

00:39:58.052 --> 00:40:00.186
what not Northern Ireland is actually in the EU or

NOTE Confidence: 0.7536324858665466

00:40:00.229 --> 00:40:00.400
not.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7529958486557007

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.466
That turns out to be a thoroughly political issue, but

NOTE Confidence: 0.7529958486557007

00:40:02.502 --> 00:40:04.160
I assume we're not in Northern Ireland either.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8260689973831177

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.936
So we're in the Republic of Ireland and all the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8260689973831177

00:40:05.974 --> 00:40:06.920
rest of the EU countries.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8605751991271973

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.813
Assuming those locations at the moment that more or less

NOTE Confidence: 0.8605751991271973

00:40:10.872 --> 00:40:13.577
we have a couple 100 cars, a couple 100 bikes,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8605751991271973

00:40:13.636 --> 00:40:16.400
5000 scooters and 5000 bikes in each in each of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8605751991271973

00:40:16.459 --> 00:40:17.399
those countries.

NOTE Confidence: 0.672340452671051

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.040
Are mostly centered around the cities.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9289112687110901

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.767
You have hardware in the vehicles that allows you to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9289112687110901

00:40:23.817 --> 00:40:24.720
collect telemetry.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8532865643501282

00:40:24.719 --> 00:40:27.891
If there's specific telemetry you want to collect, spell it

NOTE Confidence: 0.8532865643501282

00:40:27.945 --> 00:40:28.160
out.

NOTE Confidence: 0.875695526599884

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:32.176
But you could assume location and energy and power levels

NOTE Confidence: 0.875695526599884

00:40:32.244 --> 00:40:33.679
of things you can do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8757210373878479

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.163
You can also use that in that sort of hardware

NOTE Confidence: 0.8757210373878479

00:40:36.217 --> 00:40:39.239

NOTE Confidence: 0.8553134202957153

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.168
You can define the interface with those with that, that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8553134202957153

00:40:43.234 --> 00:40:47.612
sort of hardware on the vehicles themselves and include specifying

NOTE Confidence: 0.8553134202957153

00:40:47.678 --> 00:40:49.999
things like the sample rate of GPS.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9470697641372681

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.520
We are in multiple countries.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8238131403923035

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.480
So yes, we have support multiple currency.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8743107914924622

00:40:54.719 --> 00:40:57.166
The EU, lots of countries have the euro, not all

NOTE Confidence: 0.8743107914924622

00:40:57.216 --> 00:40:58.439

NOTE Confidence: 0.7863873839378357

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.600
At JG you do have support multiple languages.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7735692858695984

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.759
Do you have any budgets to consider when designing a

00:41:05.839 --> 00:41:06.559
solution?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8663409948348999

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.480
Run cost per vehicle per month?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9480289220809937

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:13.072
I'm not going to share any information about the kind

NOTE Confidence: 0.9480289220809937

00:41:13.122 --> 00:41:15.953

NOTE Confidence: 0.8767447471618652

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:20.228
However, when you're thinking about your solution, you cost should

NOTE Confidence: 0.8767447471618652

00:41:20.279 --> 00:41:21.039
come into play.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8672782778739929

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.169
We'll get into that in a minute when we talk

NOTE Confidence: 0.8672782778739929

00:41:23.211 --> 00:41:25.439
about some of the AI related aspects of this problem.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9213770627975464

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.622
But if you're proposing a solution that might have cost

NOTE Confidence: 0.9213770627975464

00:41:28.673 --> 00:41:31.239
that could change in the future, you should let us

NOTE Confidence: 0.9213770627975464

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:33.600
know and build that thinking into your model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.66315096616745

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.329

00:41:38.389 --> 00:41:41.800
the battery remaining for vehicles and for cars and vans?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7431597113609314

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.335
Yes, if or given two options when they vent it,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7431597113609314

00:41:45.383 --> 00:41:47.399
we say here's the range and if they and we

NOTE Confidence: 0.7431597113609314

00:41:47.447 --> 00:41:49.559
also ask them for a location and then we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.7431597113609314

00:41:49.607 --> 00:41:51.959
tell them if locations outside that range or not.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6471732258796692

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.300
But we kind of leave out the customer to to

NOTE Confidence: 0.6471732258796692

00:41:54.346 --> 00:41:56.879
an extent to be responsible about they use the vehicle.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7486722469329834

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.322
Is there a a system in place for customer on

NOTE Confidence: 0.7486722469329834

00:42:01.388 --> 00:42:02.240
boarding KYC?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6683191657066345

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.560
So KYC is no your customer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6920210719108582

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.840
So PV I'm going to assume you work in everywhere.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8455265164375305

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.280
Money laundering is an issue.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7155443429946899

If you're worried about KYC, this is AB to C

NOTE Confidence: 0.8569760918617249

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.711
I don't think I went through an anti money laundering

NOTE Confidence: 0.8676914572715759

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.562
But yes, you can assume we already have a pre-existing

NOTE Confidence: 0.8676914572715759

00:42:18.603 --> 00:42:20.970

NOTE Confidence: 0.8676914572715759

00:42:21.011 --> 00:42:22.880
that as not something we have to deal with in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8676914572715759

00:42:22.921 --> 00:42:23.960
this particular solution.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8856697082519531

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:28.529
And the minimum duration for booking before we charge by

NOTE Confidence: 0.8856697082519531

00:42:28.593 --> 00:42:31.079
minute, you just get charged by minute.

NOTE Confidence: 0.830036997795105

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:34.040
There is no minimum duration for that for for any

NOTE Confidence: 0.830036997795105

00:42:34.099 --> 00:42:35.039
of the vehicles.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8240440487861633

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.327
So if you would, if you want to rent a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8240440487861633

00:42:37.381 --> 00:42:39.914

NOTE Confidence: 0.9059633016586304

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.480
We just charge you for the 5 minutes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8624951243400574

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.240
All right, that was a load of questions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9336880445480347

00:42:49.239 --> 00:42:51.247

NOTE Confidence: 0.9336880445480347

00:42:51.292 --> 00:42:52.720

NOTE Confidence: 0.8563822507858276

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.467
I actually think all the things were mostly answered in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8563822507858276

NOTE Confidence: 0.4517609477043152

Just to reiterate, EUEU only.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8271761536598206

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:05.946
So that does mean multiple currency, multiple language, payment by

NOTE Confidence: 0.8271761536598206

00:43:06.023 --> 00:43:10.015
Bitcoin payment what whatever you want to do, if you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8271761536598206

00:43:10.092 --> 00:43:13.240
want to pay by Bitcoin PV, you go for it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.826352596282959

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.647
Again, you've only got a limited amount of time to

NOTE Confidence: 0.826352596282959

00:43:16.703 --> 00:43:18.639
spend on this solution and you do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7850719690322876

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.118
I think a lot of you going into a lot

NOTE Confidence: 0.8505252003669739

00:43:27.166 --> 00:43:29.596
of fine grain detail here that you won't have time

NOTE Confidence: 0.8505252003669739

00:43:29.644 --> 00:43:31.199
to reflect in your architecture.

NOTE Confidence: 0.843297004699707

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.823
So whether or not you accept Bitcoin payment is not

NOTE Confidence: 0.843297004699707

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:35.880
going to be truly change your architecture.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8177034258842468

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.217
I would also say in AB2C business, you don't take

NOTE Confidence: 0.8177034258842468

00:43:39.274 --> 00:43:42.839
Bitcoin payments unless you're doing some very specific stuff.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8728654980659485

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:47.560
HV This is an interesting one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8338191509246826

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.307
HV If we are using AI, then we need to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8338191509246826

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:53.200
take care of avoiding patent violation.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9279193878173828

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.040
So legal issues we need to take care of, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8894656896591187

00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:59.906
When you come to selecting your vendors or choosing what

NOTE Confidence: 0.8894656896591187

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.500
you want to do HV, if you've got specific views

NOTE Confidence: 0.8894656896591187

00:44:02.554 --> 00:44:05.472
around the legal issues around that, then feel free to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8894656896591187

00:44:05.526 --> 00:44:07.039
put that into your solution.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8550295233726501

00:44:07.719 --> 00:44:11.585
So some vendors, for example, will indemnify you regarding legal

NOTE Confidence: 0.8550295233726501

00:44:11.645 --> 00:44:13.879
issues if you pay for their services.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6962818503379822

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.920
Some will, some won't.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8243331909179688

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.248
If you decide HV that you want to spend time

NOTE Confidence: 0.8243331909179688

00:44:17.296 --> 00:44:19.954
researching that, then feel free to explain that in your

NOTE Confidence: 0.8243331909179688

00:44:20.001 --> 00:44:22.802
submissions and say that's a criteria that was important to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8243331909179688

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:23.039
you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7516786456108093

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.572
I think it's completely appropriate if that's something you would

NOTE Confidence: 0.7516786456108093

00:44:25.609 --> 00:44:26.120
spend time on.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8044080138206482

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.522
Well, actually we've actually kind of got a specific judging

NOTE Confidence: 0.8044080138206482

00:44:29.563 --> 00:44:31.880
criteria that might cover off some aspects in that area.

NOTE Confidence: 0.49348241090774536

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:32.440
HV though.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8569521903991699

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.240
So that's a really interesting 1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9436612725257874

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.087
So let's talk about kind of what we, we want

NOTE Confidence: 0.9436612725257874

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.759
you to do, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8749828934669495

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.015
So we've gone through the business problem and the business

NOTE Confidence: 0.8749828934669495

00:44:43.054 --> 00:44:43.360
context.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9500389695167542

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.231
I think it might be useful now to talk about

NOTE Confidence: 0.9500389695167542

00:44:46.288 --> 00:44:48.759
what we expect to see from your submissions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8917689919471741

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.387
So when I take you through the judging criteria, I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8917689919471741

00:44:51.434 --> 00:44:53.688
think you'll start to see kind of where you will

NOTE Confidence: 0.8917689919471741

00:44:53.735 --> 00:44:55.519
spend your time and focus your energy.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8942131400108337

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.552
So for each of these criteria, our judges will be

NOTE Confidence: 0.8942131400108337

00:44:58.607 --> 00:45:01.319
looking at them and judging you on each of these.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6983354091644287

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.680
Everybody's submissions will get looked at across all these criteria.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7688072323799133

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.614
And the you know, and obviously, if you decide not

NOTE Confidence: 0.7688072323799133

00:45:07.659 --> 00:45:10.049
to even deal with some of these criteria, you're part

NOTE Confidence: 0.7688072323799133

00:45:10.094 --> 00:45:12.033
you're part of it is you're going to be you

NOTE Confidence: 0.7688072323799133

00:45:12.078 --> 00:45:14.603
missing out on the opportunity to learn from the catter,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7688072323799133

00:45:14.648 --> 00:45:16.858
But also it means you're much less likely to make

NOTE Confidence: 0.7688072323799133

00:45:16.903 --> 00:45:17.760
to the semi finals.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7812644839286804

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:20.624
So what do we want to see from you in

NOTE Confidence: 0.7812644839286804

00:45:20.666 --> 00:45:21.000
general?

NOTE Confidence: 0.767448902130127

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.002
Well, we're going to want an overview for each of

NOTE Confidence: 0.767448902130127

00:45:24.063 --> 00:45:27.923
you, a short narrative describing how you've gone about solving

NOTE Confidence: 0.767448902130127

00:45:27.984 --> 00:45:28.719
the problem.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8618906140327454

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.074
We're going to get you to submit your solutions into

NOTE Confidence: 0.8618906140327454

00:45:31.115 --> 00:45:31.400
GitHub.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7911139726638794

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.894
So putting this in the read me for example, here's

NOTE Confidence: 0.7911139726638794

00:45:33.939 --> 00:45:34.719
how we solved it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.663310706615448

00:45:34.719 --> 00:45:36.891
Here's some jumping off points, but here's the broad brush

NOTE Confidence: 0.663310706615448

00:45:36.928 --> 00:45:37.640
of what we've done.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8368306159973145

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.200
We want diagrams, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9717835783958435

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.760
Pictures are really important.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8307328224182129

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.520
What does your architecture look like?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8565111756324768

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:47.122
Also highlighting where you've made use of AI based solutions

NOTE Confidence: 0.8565111756324768

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:50.917
within those diagrams boxes with arrows and words are incredibly

NOTE Confidence: 0.8565111756324768

00:45:50.976 --> 00:45:51.560
effective.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8999588489532471

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.080
We'll talk about that more shortly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7814664840698242

00:45:54.239 --> 00:45:57.278
Where you've made decisions about things you will or won't

NOTE Confidence: 0.7814664840698242

00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:00.263
use or where you've made decisions about to use specific

NOTE Confidence: 0.7814664840698242

00:46:00.316 --> 00:46:02.673
AI to to use an AI driven solution in certain

NOTE Confidence: 0.7814664840698242

00:46:02.725 --> 00:46:03.040
areas.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8679234981536865

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.660
We will expect to see sort of some kind of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8679234981536865

00:46:05.714 --> 00:46:09.165
architecture decision records or set of them describing how you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8679234981536865

00:46:09.219 --> 00:46:11.519
can't went about making certain decisions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9183757305145264

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.968
So you know, in this area here, should we use

NOTE Confidence: 0.9183757305145264

00:46:15.036 --> 00:46:15.239
AI?

NOTE Confidence: 0.788830041885376

00:46:15.239 --> 00:46:17.766
That might be a question you've got for, I don't

NOTE Confidence: 0.788830041885376

00:46:17.819 --> 00:46:20.293
know, I don't know, you might say, OK, to solve

NOTE Confidence: 0.788830041885376

00:46:20.346 --> 00:46:23.400
this particular business problem, should we use AI or not?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8780664205551147

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.760
Well, let's have a conversation about it amongst your team.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8266476988792419

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.232
What the architecture decision record is, is to an extent

NOTE Confidence: 0.8266476988792419

00:46:29.288 --> 00:46:32.312
is you taking that conversation and just putting it in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8266476988792419

00:46:32.368 --> 00:46:35.560
a simple short document where you can explain what things

NOTE Confidence: 0.8266476988792419

00:46:35.616 --> 00:46:38.360
you considered and what answers you came up with.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9474821090698242

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.310
OK, so we need to see those because we need

NOTE Confidence: 0.9474821090698242

00:46:41.362 --> 00:46:43.799
to understand the thinking process behind them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8256345987319946

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.000
Again, remember the purpose of a catter is to practice.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8489257097244263

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.682
And when you're kind of coming up with an architecture,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8489257097244263

00:46:49.731 --> 00:46:50.999
it's all about trade-offs.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8703728914260864

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.520
It's all about thinking about these issues and competing issues.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7370795011520386

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.584
The architecture decision records are a good way of kind

NOTE Confidence: 0.7370795011520386

00:46:56.632 --> 00:46:59.439

NOTE Confidence: 0.8384238481521606

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.499
And we will want you to to share sort of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8384238481521606

00:47:04.639 --> 00:47:04.999
things.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8030105829238892

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.268
And if you've gone into a lot more detail, So

NOTE Confidence: 0.8030105829238892

00:47:09.308 --> 00:47:11.624
if you've gone into very specific detail about how you're

NOTE Confidence: 0.8030105829238892

00:47:11.665 --> 00:47:14.265
going to implement certain things, maybe there are certain cloud

NOTE Confidence: 0.8030105829238892

00:47:14.305 --> 00:47:16.336
vendors you want to run on or, or certain specific

NOTE Confidence: 0.8030105829238892

00:47:16.377 --> 00:47:17.840
vendors you're going to make use of.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8502848744392395

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:22.191
Let us know who they are right when you, if

NOTE Confidence: 0.8502848744392395

00:47:22.285 --> 00:47:24.160
you've made the cut.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6148056983947754

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.546
So we're going to, I'll, I'll take you through the

NOTE Confidence: 0.800981879234314

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.119
But if you make the cut through to the semi

NOTE Confidence: 0.800981879234314

00:47:29.182 --> 00:47:32.091
final, then we will need be need to provide us

solution.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8212262988090515

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.932
And what I'm also going to do is I'll share

NOTE Confidence: 0.8212262988090515

00:47:40.953 --> 00:47:42.519
the previous cater submissions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.845909595489502

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.694
You can get some inspiration for how people go about

NOTE Confidence: 0.845909595489502

00:47:44.736 --> 00:47:46.199
putting their submissions together.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8029805421829224

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:47.676
So you know, you can get a sense of how

NOTE Confidence: 0.8029805421829224

00:47:47.714 --> 00:47:49.039
other people approach this as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.751806378364563

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.250
So for this cater, and some of you may have

NOTE Confidence: 0.751806378364563

00:47:54.308 --> 00:47:56.119
the judging criteria a little bit for these.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7444525361061096

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:58.311
I'm going to take you through the criteria we're going

NOTE Confidence: 0.7444525361061096

00:47:58.352 --> 00:48:00.057
to be looking at the 1st is we're going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7444525361061096

00:48:00.097 --> 00:48:01.640
be looking at interesting uses of Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6916281580924988

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:01.960
AI.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7924747467041016

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.075
So given our business problem that we've got, we're looking

NOTE Confidence: 0.7924747467041016

00:48:05.126 --> 00:48:07.359
for people to use Jen I in interesting ways.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8345096707344055

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:12.809
We're then going to say, OK, given the constraints that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8345096707344055

00:48:12.873 --> 00:48:16.553
I've given, how suitable the solution, how much detail are

NOTE Confidence: 0.8345096707344055

00:48:16.616 --> 00:48:19.662
you giving us about why you came up with certain

NOTE Confidence: 0.8345096707344055

00:48:19.725 --> 00:48:20.359
decisions?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8021296858787537

00:48:20.719 --> 00:48:22.933
So someone just gives us an architecture that on the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8021296858787537

00:48:22.976 --> 00:48:25.146
face of it looks great, but we can't, we understand

NOTE Confidence: 0.8021296858787537

00:48:25.189 --> 00:48:27.275
how you came up with that architecture or why you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8021296858787537

00:48:27.317 --> 00:48:28.679
didn't go a different direction.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8571866750717163

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.008
If we don't have that level of detail, you'll score

NOTE Confidence: 0.8571866750717163

00:48:31.047 --> 00:48:31.519
quite badly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8364248871803284

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.690
So even if the overall solution looks good, we don't

NOTE Confidence: 0.8364248871803284

00:48:33.727 --> 00:48:34.999
understand how you came up with it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6987040042877197

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.120
You'll score well on one, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8259507417678833

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.960
The suitability, the solution criteria.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8509783148765564

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.455
You might score quite badly in terms of giving us

NOTE Confidence: 0.8509783148765564

00:48:41.506 --> 00:48:43.160
the appropriate level of details.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7149369120597839

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:44.200
We kind of want to see both.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8061063289642334

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.616
Likewise, you might give us an architect that we'll look

NOTE Confidence: 0.8061063289642334

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:48.240
at initially.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9363617300987244

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.151
And if we don't have that level of detail, we

NOTE Confidence: 0.9363617300987244

00:48:50.187 --> 00:48:50.840
see the architect.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7052518129348755

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.160
We think that's never going to work.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7682732343673706

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.773
And it might be because there's things you've thought of

NOTE Confidence: 0.7682732343673706

00:48:54.814 --> 00:48:55.879
that we hadn't thought of.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8098373413085938

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.898
So if you give us an architecture without any of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8098373413085938

00:48:58.947 --> 00:49:01.627
the information behind giving us, helping us on how you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8098373413085938

00:49:01.676 --> 00:49:03.917
came up with it, we might just think it's also

NOTE Confidence: 0.8098373413085938

00:49:03.966 --> 00:49:04.600
not suitable.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9250100255012512

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.700
So actually giving us that level of detail will also

NOTE Confidence: 0.9250100255012512

00:49:07.751 --> 00:49:10.400
help us understand more if it's appropriate or not.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8996343612670898

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:15.236
The fourth thing here is how can you build your

NOTE Confidence: 0.8996343612670898

00:49:15.288 --> 00:49:17.621
solution in such a way that you can deal with

NOTE Confidence: 0.8996343612670898

00:49:17.672 --> 00:49:19.280
uncertainty in the world of AI?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7952984571456909

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.479
And we'll talk in a bit more detail about that

NOTE Confidence: 0.7952984571456909

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.024
shortly, but this is something that I think everyone's going

NOTE Confidence: 0.7952984571456909

00:49:24.065 --> 00:49:26.026
to have to be dealing with and looking to build

NOTE Confidence: 0.7952984571456909

00:49:26.068 --> 00:49:27.319
generally into their products.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89607173204422

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:28.960
There's a lot of uncertainty.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8758348822593689

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.703
How can you build your solution in such a way

NOTE Confidence: 0.8758348822593689

00:49:31.755 --> 00:49:34.463
that you anticipate things may need to change in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8758348822593689

00:49:34.515 --> 00:49:34.880
future?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7069223523139954

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.044
This sort of deals a little bit with, say, for

NOTE Confidence: 0.7069223523139954

00:49:37.086 --> 00:49:38.760
example, the legal concerns that HP had.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7239905595779419

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:43.617
Next we've got do the architectural characteristics of the additions

NOTE Confidence: 0.7239905595779419

00:49:43.662 --> 00:49:45.119
match the existing architecture?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8574131727218628

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.240
Actually, that's an error that shouldn't be on this slide.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8038723468780518

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.080
I apologize, I will get that removed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9129800200462341

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:57.817
And the last criteria here is the validation and verification

NOTE Confidence: 0.9129800200462341

00:49:57.904 --> 00:49:59.120
of AI results.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9053997993469238

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:02.600
So this is if you're using Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7754613161087036

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.631
AI, how do you know it's working and how can

NOTE Confidence: 0.7754613161087036

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:08.937
you how do you build that into a solution using

NOTE Confidence: 0.7754613161087036

00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:12.520
a non deterministic product in a deterministic way?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8500807881355286

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.480
Kind of tricky, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7958876490592957

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.103
So what, how are you going to work out if

NOTE Confidence: 0.7958876490592957

00:50:16.167 --> 00:50:16.679
the Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8431729078292847

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:20.000
AI stuff is behaving itself and working properly or not?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7430932521820068

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.678
Bear in mind, a big part of this is you're

NOTE Confidence: 0.7430932521820068

00:50:23.717 --> 00:50:25.160
going to work together in your teams.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9051323533058167

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.180
You're going to come up with a solution, you're going

NOTE Confidence: 0.9051323533058167

00:50:27.218 --> 00:50:28.399
to share that solution with us.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9527344703674316

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:31.960
And that's kind of great.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8401044607162476

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.073
But we can't then go and speak to you all

NOTE Confidence: 0.8401044607162476

00:50:34.112 --> 00:50:36.600
individually to understand what's going on in your heads, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8415791988372803

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:38.520
We can't speak to you all individually.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9213396906852722

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:42.222
So it's really important that you communicate with us, the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9213396906852722

00:50:42.286 --> 00:50:44.839
judges through your deliverables, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7891443371772766

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.742
So you need to get, and again, this is part

NOTE Confidence: 0.7891443371772766

00:50:47.796 --> 00:50:50.519
of what we want you to practice like an architect.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8962885141372681

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.080
You do need to communicate verbally.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8838045001029968

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:56.969
That's helpful, but also through concrete deliverables, pictures, diagrams, documents,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8838045001029968

00:50:57.025 --> 00:50:58.199
whatever it might be.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7326251864433289

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:03.436
As Jackie Reed puts it, successful communication, it's about sharing

NOTE Confidence: 0.7326251864433289

00:51:03.487 --> 00:51:06.279
and exchanging ideas resulted in shared understanding.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8962138295173645

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.917
When we read your submissions, we want to have the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8962138295173645

00:51:08.963 --> 00:51:11.790
same level of understanding about your solutions that you had

NOTE Confidence: 0.8962138295173645

00:51:11.836 --> 00:51:13.320
in terms of putting it together.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8599552512168884

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:16.204
That way we'd better understand what you're telling us and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8599552512168884

00:51:16.254 --> 00:51:18.591
we can better assess is this a good solution or

NOTE Confidence: 0.8599552512168884

00:51:18.641 --> 00:51:18.840
not.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8184028267860413

00:51:19.719 --> 00:51:22.212
If you do want to go get some more information

NOTE Confidence: 0.8184028267860413

00:51:22.266 --> 00:51:26.872
about how to communicate effectively around architecture, Jackie's book Communication

NOTE Confidence: 0.8184028267860413

00:51:26.926 --> 00:51:30.394
Patterns is really great actually, so I can thoroughly recommend

NOTE Confidence: 0.8184028267860413

00:51:30.449 --> 00:51:30.719
this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8688052296638489

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:34.160
It's all about helping developers and architects communicate more effectively.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8691259026527405

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.726
Those of you who are O'Reilly subscribers, you can of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8691259026527405

00:51:37.788 --> 00:51:40.606
course read this book for free as part of your

NOTE Confidence: 0.8691259026527405

00:51:40.667 --> 00:51:44.527
subscriptions where you've made decisions, we would like you to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8691259026527405

00:51:44.588 --> 00:51:46.119
document those decisions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8524925708770752

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:49.285
I mentioned these things called architecture decision records that they

NOTE Confidence: 0.8524925708770752

00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:51.960
they're out there in different forms and Jackie talks about

NOTE Confidence: 0.8524925708770752

00:51:52.005 --> 00:51:53.119
them in her book as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.873730480670929

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:56.096
But they are a short, like 1 to 2 pages

NOTE Confidence: 0.873730480670929

00:51:56.163 --> 00:52:00.255
simple document explaining what was a decision you made, what

NOTE Confidence: 0.873730480670929

00:52:00.322 --> 00:52:03.408
answer did you come up with, why you made that

NOTE Confidence: 0.873730480670929

00:52:03.475 --> 00:52:06.360
decision and what the trade-offs around it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7154752016067505

00:52:06.719 --> 00:52:09.843
So like, as a simple example, is this thing going

NOTE Confidence: 0.7154752016067505

00:52:09.907 --> 00:52:12.648
to be deployed on premise on our own in our

NOTE Confidence: 0.7154752016067505

00:52:12.711 --> 00:52:15.898
own data center, or we're going to deploy it after

NOTE Confidence: 0.7154752016067505

00:52:15.962 --> 00:52:16.600
the cloud?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8820488452911377

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.040
We chose the cloud.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8173409700393677

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:19.440
Why did we chose the cloud?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8842604160308838

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.067
We chose the cloud because it means we can scale

NOTE Confidence: 0.8842604160308838

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:22.800
up more quickly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8393216133117676

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.946
And that's important in this business context, that kind of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8393216133117676

00:52:25.999 --> 00:52:26.639
idea, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8443393707275391

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.881
So I had a question here, which is without us

NOTE Confidence: 0.8443393707275391

00:52:33.936 --> 00:52:37.519
actually implementing a solution, how do we validate the results?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8676323890686035

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.738
Will the judges validate the results by looking at your

NOTE Confidence: 0.8676323890686035

00:52:40.792 --> 00:52:41.280
proposal?

NOTE Confidence: 0.86460280418396

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.002
So you say, here's how I think this should be

NOTE Confidence: 0.86460280418396

00:52:44.047 --> 00:52:44.319
built.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8091475963592529

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.073
And what we're really looking at is what is the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8091475963592529

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:47.639
best proposal effective for this problem.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7511613965034485

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:50.172
So we know, you know, that's how we're going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7511613965034485

00:52:50.225 --> 00:52:53.404
validate the results is your deliverables are going to help

NOTE Confidence: 0.7511613965034485

00:52:53.458 --> 00:52:55.990
us see, ah, this, this team really got to grips

NOTE Confidence: 0.7511613965034485

00:52:56.044 --> 00:52:56.960
with the problem.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8118729591369629

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.040
They solved it in an interesting way.

NOTE Confidence: 0.788363516330719

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:01.796
They dealt with some of this AI uncertainty really, really

NOTE Confidence: 0.788363516330719

00:53:01.836 --> 00:53:02.040
well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.825291633605957

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.280
And that's what we thought their solution was best, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7706207633018494

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.896
I also mentioned it's not just like the AD Rs

NOTE Confidence: 0.7706207633018494

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:14.879
pictures are really, really important as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8399879336357117

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.696
As Neil puts it again, the goal of a diagram

NOTE Confidence: 0.8399879336357117

00:53:17.749 --> 00:53:20.463
is to create a clear and shared understanding of the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8399879336357117

00:53:20.515 --> 00:53:21.560
architecture, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9298510551452637

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:25.747
So we often have this conversation about, you know, architecture

NOTE Confidence: 0.9298510551452637

00:53:25.807 --> 00:53:29.239
diagrams being like boxes and arrows and things like that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8774105906486511

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:34.120
We don't need highly detailed complex diagrams, just simple diagrams.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9074479937553406

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:37.360
Boxes, arrows and words are absolutely fine.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7031700015068054

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:41.055
Put words on diagrams to certain things that you want

NOTE Confidence: 0.7031700015068054

00:53:41.104 --> 00:53:42.240
to focus our attention.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7931948304176331

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:46.066
Draw our attention to those areas by highlighting them some

NOTE Confidence: 0.7931948304176331

00:53:46.121 --> 00:53:47.159
way, shape or form.

NOTE Confidence: 0.877269446849823

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:51.851
If you are going to use different shapes or different

NOTE Confidence: 0.877269446849823

00:53:51.911 --> 00:53:55.547
colors to denote different things on your diagrams, a simple

NOTE Confidence: 0.877269446849823

00:53:55.607 --> 00:53:56.880
key would make sense.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9107511639595032

00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:00.440
You don't have to use any formal notation at all.

NOTE Confidence: 0.788676381111145

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.239
I don't expect to see anyone using TOE Gaff or

NOTE Confidence: 0.788676381111145

00:54:04.302 --> 00:54:06.079
UML 2 or anything like that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8171283602714539

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:09.726
If you wanted some inspiration for how to draw diagrams,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8171283602714539

00:54:09.785 --> 00:54:12.661
I would recommend taking a look at Simon Brown C4

NOTE Confidence: 0.8171283602714539

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:16.007
model which gives you the different idea about some kind

NOTE Confidence: 0.8171283602714539

00:54:16.065 --> 00:54:18.119
of diagrams you might want to draw.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7628841996192932

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.788
But whatever you want to come up with this, this

NOTE Confidence: 0.7628841996192932

00:54:21.841 --> 00:54:23.199
diagram needs to be clear.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9606400728225708

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.280
Words are useful.

NOTE Confidence: 0.941076934337616

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.240
Boxes and arrows are absolutely fine.

NOTE Confidence: 0.786882758140564

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:34.379
I wanted to put out one of this new judging

NOTE Confidence: 0.786882758140564

00:54:34.438 --> 00:54:37.862
criteria we've added in for this catter, and that's around

NOTE Confidence: 0.786882758140564

00:54:37.921 --> 00:54:40.520
this idea of dealing with uncertainty in AI.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7409913539886475

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.890
And this is a conversation that's going on across the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7409913539886475

00:54:42.925 --> 00:54:43.239
industry.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7858249545097351

00:54:43.239 --> 00:54:45.398
We've actually had it in a bunch of super streams

NOTE Confidence: 0.7858249545097351

00:54:45.442 --> 00:54:46.720
recently on the AIA platform.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6839107275009155

00:54:47.239 --> 00:54:49.476
So first thing we've got is that this space of

NOTE Confidence: 0.6839107275009155

00:54:49.525 --> 00:54:49.719
Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7815794944763184

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.720
I is still changing pretty fast.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9453030228614807

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:55.229
What is the best model is still changing month on

NOTE Confidence: 0.9453030228614807

00:54:55.294 --> 00:54:55.679
month.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8290049433708191

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:59.419
So do you have the ability to potentially switch out

NOTE Confidence: 0.8290049433708191

00:54:59.477 --> 00:55:02.342
one model for a different model if that if another

NOTE Confidence: 0.8290049433708191

00:55:02.399 --> 00:55:05.493
model comes and starts working better or the model you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8290049433708191

00:55:05.551 --> 00:55:08.760
was you were using degrade or gets removed, for example?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8796066641807556

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.538
So how, how are you able to maybe take advantage

NOTE Confidence: 0.8796066641807556

00:55:12.591 --> 00:55:14.760
of the changes that happen in the future?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8355575203895569

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:16.915
Can you build an architect such that you're ready for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8355575203895569

00:55:16.956 --> 00:55:17.160
that?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9590839147567749

00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:21.400
How would you change price fluctuation?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7516787648200989

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:23.977
So at the moment, we know the pricing being paid

NOTE Confidence: 0.7516787648200989

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:24.719
for all the Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7754743695259094

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.600
AI solutions is heavily subsidized.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8407214879989624

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.840
We don't actually know the true cost of Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9096739888191223

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:30.840
AI right now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8451694846153259

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.415
We assume those prices will raise in the future, but

NOTE Confidence: 0.8451694846153259

00:55:34.463 --> 00:55:35.759
we don't know how much buy.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8216126561164856

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:38.728
And it may be that different vendors raise their rates

NOTE Confidence: 0.8216126561164856

00:55:38.776 --> 00:55:39.679
at different times.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8099532127380371

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.714
Some of you might have been using Cursor, for example,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8099532127380371

00:55:42.765 --> 00:55:45.882
and then seeing that the prices were drastically increased and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8099532127380371

00:55:45.932 --> 00:55:49.502
that's because Cursor was using Anthropic's models, Anthropic wanted to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8099532127380371

00:55:49.552 --> 00:55:50.959
make more money out of them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7476771473884583

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:53.430
So they could put that as they could then invest

NOTE Confidence: 0.7476771473884583

00:55:53.478 --> 00:55:56.079
that money into putting their own competitor to Cursor.

NOTE Confidence: 0.718162477016449

00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:57.560
So you know, that's that's going on.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8973608613014221

00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:58.480
It's interesting, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7727215886116028

00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:01.011
So if you suddenly say, OK, we're going to use,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7727215886116028

00:56:01.062 --> 00:56:03.576
I don't know, this app right now that's and we're

NOTE Confidence: 0.7727215886116028

00:56:03.627 --> 00:56:06.192
going to use them and they're charging us and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.7727215886116028

00:56:06.243 --> 00:56:07.680
suddenly their prices spike.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8016015887260437

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:09.680
How could you deal with that situation?

NOTE Confidence: 0.707514226436615

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.983
Are there ways in which you could deal with that

NOTE Confidence: 0.707514226436615

00:56:12.031 --> 00:56:13.279
type of problem occurring?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7864708304405212

00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:15.593
Or there's certain areas in the world of AI where

NOTE Confidence: 0.7864708304405212

00:56:15.639 --> 00:56:17.280
you think price is more of an issue?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8874201774597168

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.504
What might happen if the provider you used suddenly shut

NOTE Confidence: 0.8874201774597168

00:56:22.567 --> 00:56:22.880
down?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9490039944648743

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.984
We will see companies go bust, certainly in the application

NOTE Confidence: 0.9490039944648743

00:56:27.043 --> 00:56:27.399
space.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9655591249465942

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.720
How would you handle that kind of risk?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7413153648376465

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:34.160
I had a question regarding diagrams.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6850433945655823

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:36.440
I said, is a lucid chart diagram OK?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9691143035888672

00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:37.400
Yes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9318834543228149

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:40.505
However, if you, I would strongly recommend that you don't

NOTE Confidence: 0.9318834543228149

00:56:40.558 --> 00:56:43.021
rely on us having to look at other services to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9318834543228149

00:56:43.075 --> 00:56:44.360
look at your submission.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8567681312561035

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:47.320
We've had issues in the past where people say all

NOTE Confidence: 0.8567681312561035

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:49.612
my diagrams were Lucid, we go to look at your

NOTE Confidence: 0.8567681312561035

00:56:49.662 --> 00:56:52.800
submissions and that that link hasn't been properly shared with

NOTE Confidence: 0.8567681312561035

00:56:52.850 --> 00:56:52.999
us.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8633158206939697

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:55.625
So if you want to use Lucid to create the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8633158206939697

00:56:55.683 --> 00:56:59.402
diagrams, for example Miro, I would strongly recommend doing APDF

NOTE Confidence: 0.8633158206939697

00:56:59.459 --> 00:57:02.319
export and then putting that into the GitHub repo.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9275875091552734

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:05.379
So if you can, make sure that all of the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9275875091552734

00:57:05.434 --> 00:57:08.158
resources we need to see are actually in that repo

NOTE Confidence: 0.9275875091552734

00:57:08.212 --> 00:57:10.120
just to avoid any issues like that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7230417728424072

00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:16.355
Someone also asked, could we use a cloud service for

NOTE Confidence: 0.7230417728424072

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.360
the solution or does it have to be agnostic?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7709848284721375

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.640
Doesn't have to be agnostic at all.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7647172212600708

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.976
And in fact, that might be more decisions you might

NOTE Confidence: 0.7647172212600708

00:57:22.014 --> 00:57:22.199
make.

NOTE Confidence: 0.783067524433136

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.736
You might say, we're going to go all in on

NOTE Confidence: 0.783067524433136

00:57:24.793 --> 00:57:27.382
AWS, put that into the ADR to explain why you

NOTE Confidence: 0.783067524433136

00:57:27.439 --> 00:57:28.360
want to do that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8978579044342041

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:31.913
So it is up to you to decide if you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8978579044342041

00:57:31.986 --> 00:57:35.270
want to be model or cloud or agnostic in your

NOTE Confidence: 0.8978579044342041

00:57:35.343 --> 00:57:35.999
solution.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9296825528144836

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:38.398
But if you do and it's a cost of being

NOTE Confidence: 0.9296825528144836

00:57:38.453 --> 00:57:39.680
agnostic, let us know.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8420619964599609

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:43.086
On the other hand, if you're kind of deeply enmeshed

NOTE Confidence: 0.8420619964599609

00:57:43.145 --> 00:57:46.192
in say one particular vendor, I don't know, open AI,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8420619964599609

00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:48.359
for example, then is that a problem?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8609684109687805

00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:49.320
Is that a risk to you?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8408175110816956

00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:52.575
If so, maybe explain why you've made that choice in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8408175110816956

00:57:52.638 --> 00:57:53.080
an ADR.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9066262245178223

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:55.567
If you want to call that out, we can leave

NOTE Confidence: 0.9066262245178223

00:57:55.619 --> 00:57:56.599
that in your hands.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7657530307769775

00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:00.400
But again, when thinking about uncertainty, especially in the Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7422499656677246

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.735
AI space, if you were all in one vendor, you

NOTE Confidence: 0.7422499656677246

00:58:02.788 --> 00:58:05.867
might then that that, that that does raise questions about

NOTE Confidence: 0.7422499656677246

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.628
how well you'll be able to deal with uncertainty if

NOTE Confidence: 0.7422499656677246

00:58:08.681 --> 00:58:11.759
that particular vendor increase their prices or went bust.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7660125494003296

00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:14.875
We will and are already seeing a lot more price

NOTE Confidence: 0.7660125494003296

00:58:14.932 --> 00:58:17.950
volatility in this space in in addition to firms just

NOTE Confidence: 0.7660125494003296

00:58:18.007 --> 00:58:21.138
going under all getting their IP board and getting shut

NOTE Confidence: 0.7660125494003296

00:58:21.195 --> 00:58:21.479
down.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8344136476516724

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:22.720
That's already happening today.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6566596031188965

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:28.031
Regarding how the part of the AI thing we'd like

NOTE Confidence: 0.6566596031188965

00:58:28.081 --> 00:58:30.572
some some insight on is, is knowing whether or not

NOTE Confidence: 0.6566596031188965

00:58:30.622 --> 00:58:31.320
your your Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.769565999507904

00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:36.120
IR AI powered functionality is actually working or not, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8691156506538391

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.240
How do you know if your AI stuff is working?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6524011492729187

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:39.960
OK?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7189880609512329

00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:43.760
So we're used to verifying how deterministic systems work.

NOTE Confidence: 0.664957582950592

00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:47.688
We're less used to understanding how Jai functionality works because

NOTE Confidence: 0.664957582950592

00:58:47.746 --> 00:58:49.479
it's they get undeterministic.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8791481852531433

00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:52.810
So can we build things into your system to to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8791481852531433

00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:53.720
consider this?

NOTE Confidence: 0.745032548904419

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:57.981
And how will you know if it starts misbehaving once

NOTE Confidence: 0.745032548904419

00:58:58.042 --> 00:59:01.448
you get into production again, if you're relying on, say

NOTE Confidence: 0.745032548904419

00:59:01.508 --> 00:59:05.522
third parties models, for example, and those just start degrading,

NOTE Confidence: 0.745032548904419

00:59:05.583 --> 00:59:06.799
that happens, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.5421164035797119

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.822
The Hampton Anthropic, very recently, some bugs happened in their

NOTE Confidence: 0.5421164035797119

00:59:09.868 --> 00:59:12.240
systems, the quality that models started degrading.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9490245580673218

00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.704
Would you notice and would you be able to react

NOTE Confidence: 0.9490245580673218

00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:16.959
to that situation?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6021857261657715

00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.452
Now, GC says, when you refer to AI, are you

NOTE Confidence: 0.6021857261657715

00:59:21.514 --> 00:59:25.463
specifically talking about any AI model or is it interchangeable

NOTE Confidence: 0.6021857261657715

00:59:25.524 --> 00:59:26.079
with Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7120693325996399

00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:26.400
AI?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8553127646446228

00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:30.280
So I mean, these terms get used interchangeably, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6578113436698914

00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:31.520
Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8161583542823792

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:34.884
AI and AI, we're talking here about anything that markets

NOTE Confidence: 0.8161583542823792

00:59:34.942 --> 00:59:37.508
itself as AIA, lot of which is, you know, ML

NOTE Confidence: 0.8161583542823792

00:59:37.567 --> 00:59:40.600
and stats, let's be clear, doesn't really matter GC.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7213737964630127

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:43.653
So if you think so, maybe putting that to one

NOTE Confidence: 0.7213737964630127

00:59:43.721 --> 00:59:44.400
side vote.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8258494734764099

00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:46.520
If you think there are solutions called Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8159363269805908

00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:48.754
AI or AI that help and you want to use

NOTE Confidence: 0.8159363269805908

00:59:48.813 --> 00:59:51.399
them, bring them in, talk about them, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9622358679771423

00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:54.967
You might also say, I don't think I should be

NOTE Confidence: 0.9622358679771423

00:59:55.033 --> 00:59:57.640
using any of this stuff and here's why.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8070301413536072

00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:01.413
Make a compelling case, although we again, we sort of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8070301413536072

01:00:01.479 --> 01:00:03.679
want you to practice things here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8283885717391968

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:06.646
So we would, we are expecting people to have made

NOTE Confidence: 0.8283885717391968

01:00:06.707 --> 01:00:08.159
use of some kind of Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.710972785949707

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.840
AI type solution as part of their problem.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8263425827026367

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.881
Because we want you to think through that space, understand

NOTE Confidence: 0.8263425827026367

01:00:12.933 --> 01:00:15.562
that space a bit more, understand how to build that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8263425827026367

01:00:15.614 --> 01:00:16.800
into your architecture.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7678971886634827

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.451
So you know, if you decide you don't want to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7678971886634827

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.869
get involved with that, then you kind of sort of

NOTE Confidence: 0.7678971886634827

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:24.337
almost opting out of part of the cater process to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7678971886634827

01:00:24.386 --> 01:00:24.880
an extent.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8942806124687195

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.088
Are we assuming that our diagrams will be consumed by

NOTE Confidence: 0.8942806124687195

01:00:31.141 --> 01:00:32.360
technical stakeholders?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6738871932029724

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.440
Should they be suitable for a range of technical?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7736025452613831

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:35.480
Would you know what?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8835445642471313

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:39.699
Let me introduce MB, the technical stakeholders who will be

NOTE Confidence: 0.8835445642471313

01:00:39.768 --> 01:00:43.208
looking at your diagrams because it is now time to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8835445642471313

01:00:43.276 --> 01:00:46.992
meet the judges because we have expert judges who will

NOTE Confidence: 0.8835445642471313

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.400
be going through your submissions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9009901285171509

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.076
And these people are very technical and they're going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9009901285171509

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:53.879
get to introduce themselves in just a moment.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9298949241638184

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.119
These are the people that will be going through your

NOTE Confidence: 0.9298949241638184

01:00:57.181 --> 01:01:01.479
submissions and trying to understand your thinking process, and we'll

NOTE Confidence: 0.9298949241638184

01:01:01.541 --> 01:01:05.341
be assessing your submissions based on those criteria that we

NOTE Confidence: 0.9298949241638184

01:01:05.403 --> 01:01:06.399
outlined before.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7880500555038452

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.520
We've got two of our three judges.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6936035752296448

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.680
Our third judge, unfortunately, is unavailable today.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5260037779808044

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.440
He's probably on a plane somewhere.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8337886333465576

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:17.065
But let's start with our first judge and our first

NOTE Confidence: 0.8337886333465576

01:01:17.146 --> 01:01:19.320
judge is Andrew Harmel Law.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8631150722503662

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:23.307
Andrew, could you maybe briefly introduce yourself and talk to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8631150722503662

01:01:23.368 --> 01:01:26.393
talk about the the kinds of things that you'll be

NOTE Confidence: 0.8631150722503662

01:01:26.455 --> 01:01:29.480
focusing on when looking through the submissions?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7630506157875061

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:30.840
Yeah, sure, Sam.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8539713025093079

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.000
And thanks everybody for turning up.

NOTE Confidence: 0.848812997341156

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:33.600
I've seen this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.939111053943634

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.981
There's a lot of people here, so it's kind of

NOTE Confidence: 0.939111053943634

01:01:36.019 --> 01:01:36.360
exciting.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8796105980873108

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.628
So there's a lot of words on the screen and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8796105980873108

01:01:38.681 --> 01:01:41.266
because I've been around for a long time and done

NOTE Confidence: 0.8796105980873108

01:01:41.319 --> 01:01:42.479
quite a lot of things.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8638440370559692

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.459
But what I've what I'm really looking for is, is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8638440370559692

01:01:45.521 --> 01:01:47.879
kind of a point that Sam keeps making.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9024917483329773

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:50.832
And and it's it's the central kind of argument of

NOTE Confidence: 0.9024917483329773

01:01:50.892 --> 01:01:52.520
the book that I've written.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6927915811538696

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.800
It's on the O'Reilly platforms.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7554969191551208

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.199
If you if you want an in depth view of

NOTE Confidence: 0.7554969191551208

01:01:55.235 --> 01:01:56.737
what I think you could have a look at that

NOTE Confidence: 0.7554969191551208

01:01:56.773 --> 01:01:58.919
the book which is called Facilitating Software Architecture.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8495255708694458

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:02.000
But the key thing I'm looking for is, as Sam

NOTE Confidence: 0.8495255708694458

01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:05.080
said, kind of seeing your train of thought.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9081423878669739

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.112
There will be an end result, which will be your

NOTE Confidence: 0.9081423878669739

01:02:07.155 --> 01:02:09.490
architecture, but there are lots of kind of things you

NOTE Confidence: 0.9081423878669739

01:02:09.533 --> 01:02:11.392
can do to show us your thinking and show us

NOTE Confidence: 0.9081423878669739

01:02:11.435 --> 01:02:12.559
how you got to that point.

NOTE Confidence: 0.92063969373703

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:15.788
And so that's the kind of stuff that I'm going

NOTE Confidence: 0.92063969373703

01:02:15.828 --> 01:02:16.559
to be looking for.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9123601913452148

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.146
If, if it just feels like you've picked something out

NOTE Confidence: 0.9123601913452148

01:02:19.195 --> 01:02:21.440
of thin air, then it might be a good solution.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7913018465042114

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.593
But knowing why you've picked it, that's how I'll be

NOTE Confidence: 0.7913018465042114

01:02:24.651 --> 01:02:27.393
able to and, and, and also Sam Guthrie and Kent

NOTE Confidence: 0.7913018465042114

01:02:27.451 --> 01:02:29.960
will be able to, to, to, to, to judge this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9782149791717529

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.400
And that's what I'm looking for.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9342440962791443

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.638
So just, you know, I'm far more interested in your

NOTE Confidence: 0.9342440962791443

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:34.400
thought process.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8529573082923889

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.000
And as Sam said, there is no right answer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9455710053443909

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.120
So why you think yours is appropriate?

NOTE Confidence: 0.864544153213501

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.840
That's going to be super key.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9111037850379944

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.407
So that's what I'm looking out for and reading everybody's

NOTE Confidence: 0.9111037850379944

01:02:43.451 --> 01:02:45.841
submissions because there will be a vast array of them

NOTE Confidence: 0.9111037850379944

01:02:45.885 --> 01:02:48.054
and there will be lots of different ways of doing

NOTE Confidence: 0.9111037850379944

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:48.319
this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8585606813430786

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.899
And that's what I'm really looking forward to, just seeing

NOTE Confidence: 0.8585606813430786

01:02:50.943 --> 01:02:53.523
really interesting ways that people come up with to figure

NOTE Confidence: 0.8585606813430786

01:02:53.567 --> 01:02:55.479
out what they think is a good fit for this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8232276439666748

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.840
So I'm looking forward to.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6850574016571045

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:58.400
It awesome.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7384967803955078

01:02:58.760 --> 01:02:59.360
Thank you Andrew.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8662238717079163

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:02.743
We, I've prepared a link to Andrew's book in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8662238717079163

01:03:02.801 --> 01:03:05.816
attendee chat just to let you know that there's some

NOTE Confidence: 0.8662238717079163

01:03:05.874 --> 01:03:08.947
resources that are, are kind of being shared with you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8662238717079163

01:03:09.005 --> 01:03:12.542
regarding the schedule and the submission process and how you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8662238717079163

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.442
can join teams and those are available for you as

NOTE Confidence: 0.8662238717079163

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.080
resources.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8883609175682068

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.998
I will also be sharing a link to a repository

NOTE Confidence: 0.8883609175682068

01:03:20.068 --> 01:03:23.880
of previous cater submissions in just a moment as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7893857359886169

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.040
And I'll put that link into the attendee chat too.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6760029792785645

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.760
You should go and look at the previous submissions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9050453901290894

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.080
But thank you so much, Andrew.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7000972628593445

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.542
And you should, you do need to go read Andrew's

NOTE Confidence: 0.7000972628593445

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:30.759
books.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7280791997909546

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:31.160
It's great.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8653732538223267

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.265
And I'll put the link for you in the attendee

NOTE Confidence: 0.8653732538223267

01:03:33.308 --> 01:03:33.519
chat.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8816273808479309

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:37.216
Thank you so much, Andrew, and on to our next

NOTE Confidence: 0.8816273808479309

01:03:37.293 --> 01:03:37.760
judge.

NOTE Confidence: 0.40126994252204895

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:38.240
Go 3.

NOTE Confidence: 0.23683267831802368

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:38.800
Go 3.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5178787708282471

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:40.320
Hi.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6233501434326172

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.160
Hi everyone.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9212718605995178

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.080
So nice to be here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7589863538742065

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.280
Looking forward to interesting Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6999503970146179

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.373
AI solutions for the interesting problems that Sam had put

NOTE Confidence: 0.6999503970146179

01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:50.119
put together.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8017913103103638

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:55.855
I'm currently actually looking at the enterprise solutions and trying

NOTE Confidence: 0.8017913103103638

01:03:55.922 --> 01:03:58.840
to add AI in meaningful ways for my clients.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8908711075782776

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.125
So that's the portion that I'm interested in seeing the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8908711075782776

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.640
solution for this particular problem as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8649615049362183

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:10.043
So I'm particularly looking for assumptions being clearly called out

NOTE Confidence: 0.8649615049362183

01:04:10.123 --> 01:04:10.599
there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9273682832717896

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.919
I mean like the questions that we have today, there

NOTE Confidence: 0.9273682832717896

01:04:12.958 --> 01:04:14.840
might be some assumptions that you want to make.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8721819519996643

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:18.789
So clearly calling out that assumptions and therefore deriving some

NOTE Confidence: 0.8721819519996643

01:04:18.843 --> 01:04:19.720
solutions to it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7670477032661438

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.533
And also the risks that Sam had been talking about

NOTE Confidence: 0.7670477032661438

01:04:22.583 --> 01:04:24.079
of all the uncertainty, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9100677371025085

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.847
Like how do we want to protect the business revenue

NOTE Confidence: 0.9100677371025085

01:04:26.901 --> 01:04:29.180
in spite of all the risks out there in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9100677371025085

01:04:29.234 --> 01:04:29.559
space?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8157775402069092

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:33.120
So calling out those things will be useful to see.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8654212355613708

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.656
And yeah, it's going to be fun to, you know,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8654212355613708

01:04:36.728 --> 01:04:40.150
think about a lot of a solutions because it's an

NOTE Confidence: 0.8654212355613708

01:04:40.221 --> 01:04:44.428
enthusiastic space, but at the same time, what really works

NOTE Confidence: 0.8654212355613708

01:04:44.499 --> 01:04:47.279
in terms of pricing and practicalities.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9006494879722595

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.043
So that's another space that I want to keenly look

NOTE Confidence: 0.9006494879722595

01:04:50.098 --> 01:04:50.320
for.

NOTE Confidence: 0.28236955404281616

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:52.880
And and guide me.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8270260095596313

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.724
We should also probably put a link to your own

NOTE Confidence: 0.8270260095596313

01:04:55.786 --> 01:04:58.879
book as well because you've also written a book by

NOTE Confidence: 0.8270260095596313

01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:00.919
Riley called Full Snack Testing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8251099586486816

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.653
Do you know, maybe just share a bit about that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8251099586486816

01:05:02.691 --> 01:05:02.880
book?

NOTE Confidence: 0.47184887528419495

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:04.000
Yep.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7895622849464417

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:08.627
So actually it's a book about 10 different agile testing

NOTE Confidence: 0.7895622849464417

01:05:08.709 --> 01:05:14.280
skills both on functional and non functional testing and automation.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8528051972389221

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:19.094
So anybody who's thinking of doing continuous delivery needs to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8528051972389221

01:05:19.164 --> 01:05:23.400
incorporate all these kinds of quality engineering practices.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8835363984107971

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.373
And that's the book about it's a step by step

NOTE Confidence: 0.8835363984107971

01:05:25.416 --> 01:05:25.679
guide.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8381710648536682

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:28.652
So second edition is coming out in the next year

NOTE Confidence: 0.8381710648536682

01:05:28.708 --> 01:05:31.119
with all of these a A capabilities as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8152110576629639

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:34.747
So I'll put in a link for folks to read

NOTE Confidence: 0.8152110576629639

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:35.119
on.

NOTE Confidence: 0.839455246925354

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:38.520
Awesome.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9525323510169983

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.440
Thank you so much.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8125649094581604

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:45.440
Both Guy 3 and Andrew.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9164271354675293

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:49.840
Now normally we would have 1/3 judge to introduce themselves.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8816362023353577

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.151
The third judge will be with us in the semifinal

NOTE Confidence: 0.8816362023353577

01:05:52.199 --> 01:05:55.040
and finals and will be involved in judging the submissions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7719492316246033

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.760
Unfortunately, they're on a plane.

NOTE Confidence: 0.863143265247345

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.440
So our third judge is Kent Beck.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8955777883529663

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.551
Some of you may have heard of Kent Beck before

NOTE Confidence: 0.8955777883529663

01:06:01.618 --> 01:06:02.159
he came.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80302894115448

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.216
He sort of came up with Extreme programming back in

NOTE Confidence: 0.80302894115448

01:06:05.275 --> 01:06:09.239
the day, which is my preferred software development methodology and

NOTE Confidence: 0.80302894115448

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:11.959
also help popularize test driven development.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9038233757019043

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.328
And also more recently had written the book Tidy First,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9038233757019043

01:06:15.385 --> 01:06:17.774
which is a great book to help you clean up

NOTE Confidence: 0.9038233757019043

01:06:17.831 --> 01:06:18.400
your code.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8099017143249512

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.479
Ken will be joining us for the semi final and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8099017143249512

01:06:21.543 --> 01:06:22.759
the finals as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7002738118171692

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:26.740
We had a couple of a few other questions that

NOTE Confidence: 0.7002738118171692

01:06:26.813 --> 01:06:28.480
have come into the Q&A.

NOTE Confidence: 0.14707377552986145

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:29.800
Ms.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8456465601921082

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.720
asks, can we use Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9359723329544067

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.680
AI to come up with the architecture?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9127715229988098

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:39.040
I mean, look, we're not going to check your homework.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9452967643737793

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.480
This isn't a job interview.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9246798157691956

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:45.310
But the purpose of this catter is for you to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9246798157691956

01:06:45.388 --> 01:06:49.934
learn about how to come up with an appropriate architecture

NOTE Confidence: 0.9246798157691956

01:06:50.012 --> 01:06:53.480
to consider trade-offs and to make decisions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9165664315223694

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.637
If you just go and use ChatGPT to generate an

NOTE Confidence: 0.9165664315223694

01:06:56.693 --> 01:06:59.098
answer for you, I think you have to ask the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9165664315223694

01:06:59.154 --> 01:07:01.840
question, what have you got out of that process?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7559848427772522

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:06.280
So kind of that's on you really like that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.4764889180660248

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.640
That's like the catter.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9051427245140076

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.840
We are here to facilitate your learning and your education.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8051762580871582

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.520
If you want to use a Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8684276342391968

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:15.070
AI solutions that you don't engage with any of that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8684276342391968

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:18.120
process, that's fine, but you're probably wasting your time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.755491316318512

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.720
Now, obviously you might use Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8159344792366028

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.004
AI to help you prepare some of the deliverables, for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8159344792366028

01:07:22.048 --> 01:07:22.399
example.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8542044162750244

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.960
So certainly we've had people that have used Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7175844311714172

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.766
AI to help them create this pitch videos, for example,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7175844311714172

01:07:27.818 --> 01:07:30.052
you know, but like for some of the ADR, you

NOTE Confidence: 0.7175844311714172

01:07:30.104 --> 01:07:31.560
need to do the ADR yourself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7877361178398132

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.694
You need to have the conversations, you need to do

NOTE Confidence: 0.7877361178398132

01:07:33.735 --> 01:07:34.639
the trade-offs, right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.830901563167572

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.160
But then maybe you might use a Gen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8023343086242676

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.600
AI video to say, OK, here's a, here's a script.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7250531315803528

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.760
Can you come up with a cool video for us?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8565183877944946

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:40.720
That's kind of fine, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8134786486625671

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.240
But it's about you and your learning.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7594159245491028

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.696
So that just hopefully that kind of gives you a

NOTE Confidence: 0.7594159245491028

01:07:47.743 --> 01:07:48.160
sense Ms.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7744951248168945

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.205
of, of where we expect these, these, these things to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7744951248168945

01:07:50.245 --> 01:07:50.559
be used.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7991297245025635

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:55.735
So VC, so we expected to submit an extension to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7991297245025635

01:07:55.803 --> 01:07:57.559
the existing architecture.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8667513132095337

01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:00.169
Now that was a mistake on my part on the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8667513132095337

01:08:00.235 --> 01:08:03.823
judging criteria that is down as a judging criteria VC,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8667513132095337

01:08:03.888 --> 01:08:05.519
that's entirely my fault.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8693139553070068

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.955
So just to be really clear, so we get to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8693139553070068

01:08:08.016 --> 01:08:09.599
the judging criteria here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8658487796783447

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:15.183
So this judging criteria here, right, this one here, that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8658487796783447

01:08:15.271 --> 01:08:21.042
criteria we are going to remove because we're effectively assuming

NOTE Confidence: 0.8658487796783447

01:08:21.129 --> 01:08:25.588
that this is a Greenfield system so that there's no

NOTE Confidence: 0.8658487796783447

01:08:25.676 --> 01:08:27.600
existing architecture.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9066805839538574

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:30.443
So please VC, just ignore that point and I'll get

NOTE Confidence: 0.9066805839538574

01:08:30.501 --> 01:08:33.577
that removed from the sheet that the judges use after

NOTE Confidence: 0.9066805839538574

01:08:33.635 --> 01:08:34.680
the event as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5947915315628052

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.960
Take a look at some of the questions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5935989022254944

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:42.160
I think we had a question about cloud services which

NOTE Confidence: 0.5935989022254944

01:08:42.221 --> 01:08:42.960
we answered.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8445563912391663

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:46.839
Would it be considered fair game to lean on data

NOTE Confidence: 0.8445563912391663

01:08:46.893 --> 01:08:50.466
AI capability platforms such as Salesforce Data Cloud or Agentforce

NOTE Confidence: 0.8445563912391663

01:08:50.519 --> 01:08:53.346
if you think that's the most appropriate way to solve

NOTE Confidence: 0.8445563912391663

01:08:53.399 --> 01:08:54.039
the problem?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9236506223678589

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:54.920
Absolutely.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9393371939659119

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:58.604
I would come back to that criteria around dealing with

NOTE Confidence: 0.9393371939659119

01:08:58.666 --> 01:09:01.719
uncertainty in the world of AI technology though.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7838500142097473

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.104
So if you say I went all in on a

NOTE Confidence: 0.7838500142097473

01:09:04.169 --> 01:09:07.847
Salesforce Data Cloud, but then other people came up with

NOTE Confidence: 0.7838500142097473

01:09:07.911 --> 01:09:11.589
better solutions and you're all in on South Cloud, that's

NOTE Confidence: 0.7838500142097473

01:09:11.654 --> 01:09:12.880
a trade off, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6746885180473328

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.240
So you've had a trade off conversation.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7999250888824463

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.087
You said I'm going to be all in, but if

NOTE Confidence: 0.7999250888824463

01:09:16.135 --> 01:09:19.309
their technology doesn't continue to get better and everyone else's

NOTE Confidence: 0.7999250888824463

01:09:19.357 --> 01:09:21.678
does, you might be stuck on the wrong platform or

NOTE Confidence: 0.7999250888824463

01:09:21.726 --> 01:09:24.521
if sales force start increasing prices because you're now a

NOTE Confidence: 0.7999250888824463

01:09:24.568 --> 01:09:27.080
captive market, which is exactly what they do, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7195662260055542

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.520
It's part of their business model, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8663505911827087

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.920
That needs to be part of your ADR.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8282406330108643

01:09:31.479 --> 01:09:34.476
So you might say we could do it because maybe

NOTE Confidence: 0.8282406330108643

01:09:34.542 --> 01:09:38.337
we get going quicker, but an acknowledged trade off there

NOTE Confidence: 0.8282406330108643

01:09:38.404 --> 01:09:42.000
is that we might have issues around portability later.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7620347142219543

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:46.377
Gregor Hopes actually got some great articles about thinking about

NOTE Confidence: 0.7620347142219543

01:09:46.424 --> 01:09:48.535
cloud vendor lock in if you were to look into

NOTE Confidence: 0.7620347142219543

01:09:48.582 --> 01:09:50.741
those and some of the trade off models that he

NOTE Confidence: 0.7620347142219543

01:09:50.788 --> 01:09:51.680
uses in that space.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7329958081245422

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.960
But that should be a consideration of his solution.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8374456167221069

01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:55.400
Please talk about it in there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8634893298149109

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.870
Will the review and feedback to be to be submitted

NOTE Confidence: 0.8634893298149109

01:10:01.944 --> 01:10:04.000
material be publicly shared?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8806518912315369

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:05.800
We do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.922986626625061

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.120
We do share these things publicly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9129691123962402

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.398
I think anything you share, you should feel like it

NOTE Confidence: 0.9129691123962402

01:10:10.443 --> 01:10:11.559
is being shared publicly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9331199526786804

01:10:12.439 --> 01:10:14.825
In terms of the feedback we give, kind of we

NOTE Confidence: 0.9331199526786804

01:10:14.879 --> 01:10:17.536
don't go back and give every single team lots and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9331199526786804

01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:19.000
lots of detailed feedback.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7807462811470032

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.839
We typically at the end sort of say here's who's

NOTE Confidence: 0.7807462811470032

01:10:21.893 --> 01:10:22.760
who got through.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8889291882514954

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.566
So we don't go through and share all of our

NOTE Confidence: 0.8889291882514954

01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:28.375
detailed notes on every single participant just because it just

NOTE Confidence: 0.8889291882514954

01:10:28.419 --> 01:10:29.560
takes too long to do that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7997835278511047

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:32.461
But certainly your submissions will be shared and I think

NOTE Confidence: 0.7997835278511047

01:10:32.505 --> 01:10:34.919
you should submit it with the view of that's happening.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8522735238075256

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:39.520
You shouldn't be submitting like proprietary or or sensitive information.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8898975253105164

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.880
This stuff is going into a GitHub repo.

NOTE Confidence: 0.818176805973053

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.087
So actually on that basis, if you want to review

NOTE Confidence: 0.818176805973053

01:10:46.153 --> 01:10:50.705
the some of the previous submissions, Jackie Reed actually maintained

NOTE Confidence: 0.818176805973053

01:10:50.771 --> 01:10:54.334
something called the catalog and that is a GitHub repo

NOTE Confidence: 0.818176805973053

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:57.039
where we keep all of our Cata solutions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8845424056053162

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.061
So you can actually go there and see what other

NOTE Confidence: 0.8845424056053162

01:11:00.112 --> 01:11:03.306
people submitted to the very different problems and that might

NOTE Confidence: 0.8845424056053162

01:11:03.357 --> 01:11:04.800
help you with some solution.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7961495518684387

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.784
I'm just trying to see if I've answered all these

NOTE Confidence: 0.7961495518684387

01:11:08.835 --> 01:11:09.640
other questions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8537726998329163

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.720
So I think I've answered about cancelling the hires.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9648184776306152

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:15.720
That's fine.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8298466205596924

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:20.189
Joan, if there's a question in the Q&A about whether

NOTE Confidence: 0.8298466205596924

01:11:20.235 --> 01:11:22.855
not every team member needs an active O'Reilly account, I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8298466205596924

01:11:22.901 --> 01:11:24.280
don't know the answer to that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7589930891990662

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.560
If you could put an answer to that's question 39.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6950058341026306

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.800
Joan's a real smart person here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8308529853820801

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:31.169
I'm just, you know, I'm just a good looking face

NOTE Confidence: 0.8308529853820801

NOTE Confidence: 0.682736873626709

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.680
Are there any specific requirements regarding authorization authentication?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6969645619392395

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:41.320
Nothing specific, KIPV says.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7854569554328918

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.720
I'm new to architectural catters.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8747917413711548

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.720
I'm not sure about participating.

NOTE Confidence: 0.722345232963562

NOTE Confidence: 0.8563348054885864

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.644
I would urge you to do it as part of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8563348054885864

01:11:49.694 --> 01:11:51.599
a team PV Sorry I missed that earlier.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9100395441055298

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.400
I would urge you to join a team.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7388957738876343

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.560
There's actually a sign up sheet.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5514287352561951

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.320
That's what she had a link to.

NOTE Confidence: 0.808695912361145

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:59.374
There are people that are looking for team members part

NOTE Confidence: 0.808695912361145

01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:02.762
of this, you know, it's incredibly, vanishingly rare that an

NOTE Confidence: 0.808695912361145

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:06.039
architecture has come up with by one person by themselves.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8052679896354675

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.058
I don't think it's actually healthy either in the real

NOTE Confidence: 0.8052679896354675

01:12:08.095 --> 01:12:08.320
world.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8635464310646057

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.126
So actually working as a team is a big part

NOTE Confidence: 0.8635464310646057

01:12:11.175 --> 01:12:11.999
of this exercise.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8721990585327148

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.220
There are definitely people looking for help and there's details

NOTE Confidence: 0.8721990585327148

01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:17.585
in the resources about how you can sign up and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8721990585327148

01:12:17.636 --> 01:12:18.239
join a team.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9175247550010681

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.075
So PV like, you know, be as brave as you

NOTE Confidence: 0.9175247550010681

01:12:21.145 --> 01:12:24.335
can and I'm sure you'll find a team that will

NOTE Confidence: 0.9175247550010681

01:12:24.406 --> 01:12:26.319
welcome you with open arms.

NOTE Confidence: 0.896014392375946

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.520
It's a lot of work to try doing this by

NOTE Confidence: 0.896014392375946

01:12:29.576 --> 01:12:33.639
yourself and it's very difficult to have conversations around trade-offs

NOTE Confidence: 0.896014392375946

01:12:33.695 --> 01:12:35.840
and around options by yourself, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8063123226165771

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.559
It's a lot easier to do that with more than

NOTE Confidence: 0.8063123226165771

01:12:37.599 --> 01:12:38.319
one of you around.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8804389238357544

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:41.120
I think that's all the questions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9017989635467529

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.070
And I think we did set a record for the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9017989635467529

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:43.920
questions today.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8578618764877319

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.659
So how do you, how are you going to submit

NOTE Confidence: 0.8578618764877319

01:12:46.721 --> 01:12:47.519
your problem?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8976386785507202

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:49.893
You are going to create a GitHub repo for your

NOTE Confidence: 0.8976386785507202

01:12:49.944 --> 01:12:51.080
problem and submit it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8039731383323669

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.080
We'll give you the details and the link to that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8857063055038452

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.840
That's going to be on the next slide.

NOTE Confidence: 0.815362811088562

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:58.520
Please include all your documentations and visuals in the repo.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8149208426475525

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:01.693
So just again, you may have used various cloud based

NOTE Confidence: 0.8149208426475525

01:13:01.754 --> 01:13:05.599
services to create, you know, documents or create like visuals.

NOTE Confidence: 0.805350661277771

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.992
Just get them exported in such a way that they

NOTE Confidence: 0.805350661277771

01:13:08.035 --> 01:13:10.199
can actually be in that GitHub repo and downloaded.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8324464559555054

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.323
Also remember that quite often, like I have in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8324464559555054

01:13:13.378 --> 01:13:16.639
past, our judges will be judging these submissions offline.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5562035441398621

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.560
Like I went downloaded GitHub repo.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8362003564834595

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.564
I might be on my daily commute, I might be

NOTE Confidence: 0.8362003564834595

01:13:21.606 --> 01:13:23.454
on a plane, wanted to go through some of the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8362003564834595

01:13:23.496 --> 01:13:24.000
submissions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7901215553283691

01:13:24.439 --> 01:13:26.457
So again, if everything can be in that GitHub repo,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7901215553283691

01:13:26.497 --> 01:13:28.040
you make it much easier for the judges.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8925033211708069

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:30.451
You want to make it as easy as possible for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8925033211708069

01:13:30.508 --> 01:13:32.920
the judges to see how smart you are, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8534664511680603

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.741
That's what we need you to do, make it easy

NOTE Confidence: 0.8534664511680603

01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:35.360
for our judges.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7765552401542664

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.867
Make sure to have a simple read me on the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7765552401542664

01:13:39.914 --> 01:13:41.719
repo, a very simple kicking off point.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8226415514945984

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:42.520
Here's what we've done.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5124151110649109

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:43.440
Here's how he went about it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9037226438522339

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.520
Here's the main things.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6845543384552002

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.568
So just if you just gave us like a whole

NOTE Confidence: 0.6845543384552002

01:13:46.611 --> 01:13:48.814
folder for the loads and loads of documents we can,

NOTE Confidence: 0.6845543384552002

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:50.499
I can have to try and put some more of

NOTE Confidence: 0.6845543384552002

01:13:50.542 --> 01:13:51.320
that to ourselves.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6429944634437561

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:53.798
So try using that read me to sort of structure

NOTE Confidence: 0.6429944634437561

01:13:53.852 --> 01:13:56.599
which documents will look up, ask to look at first.

NOTE Confidence: 0.778992772102356

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:58.520
That really helpful.

NOTE Confidence: 0.859061598777771

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.011
Again, make it as easy as possible for us to

NOTE Confidence: 0.859061598777771

01:14:01.068 --> 01:14:02.879
understand the special solution.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7103513479232788

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:05.432
And again, looking at the catalog, you'll see some examples

NOTE Confidence: 0.7103513479232788

01:14:05.475 --> 01:14:08.158
of problems that it's done, but examples of submissions that's

NOTE Confidence: 0.7103513479232788

01:14:08.201 --> 01:14:10.581
done really well and other examples where it could have

NOTE Confidence: 0.7103513479232788

01:14:10.624 --> 01:14:11.360
been done better.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7857010364532471

01:14:13.479 --> 01:14:16.535
For the one last question, RL had a question about

NOTE Confidence: 0.7857010364532471

01:14:16.596 --> 01:14:17.880
the business context.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7965213656425476

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.154
What's it mean that bikes can be kept up to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7965213656425476

01:14:20.199 --> 01:14:20.600
12 hours?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8668540120124817

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:23.094
What it means is that when you say you get

NOTE Confidence: 0.8668540120124817

01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:25.389
a bike or a scooter, in fact, and you say

NOTE Confidence: 0.8668540120124817

01:14:25.443 --> 01:14:27.847
this now bike or my scooter is mine, that is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8668540120124817

01:14:27.902 --> 01:14:29.759
limited to up to a 12 hour window.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8656246662139893

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.000
So you have to have returned it within 12 hours.

NOTE Confidence: 0.77073734998703

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.120
That's just a limit on how long they're allowed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7344024181365967

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.336
People are allowed to have the bike or the scooter

NOTE Confidence: 0.7344024181365967

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:38.508
for, so they actually have to have parked it and

NOTE Confidence: 0.7344024181365967

01:14:38.553 --> 01:14:39.439
finished their ride.

NOTE Confidence: 0.91044682264328

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.121
So if you decide to, you know, get the bike

NOTE Confidence: 0.91044682264328

01:14:42.174 --> 01:14:44.455
back from the pub and you leave the bike in

NOTE Confidence: 0.91044682264328

01:14:44.508 --> 01:14:47.320
your front garden, you're still being charged for it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7762713432312012

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:50.824
We need it back within 12 hours, otherwise penalty stop

NOTE Confidence: 0.7762713432312012

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:51.839
coming into play.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6631025075912476

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:56.880
All right, how you submit your problem?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7299178242683411

01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:58.680
I've gone through this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6093361973762512

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.400
So the cater schedule all teams.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8120242953300476

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.367
We need you to submit information via this Google form

NOTE Confidence: 0.8120242953300476

01:15:06.437 --> 01:15:08.600
by Wednesday, October the 15th.

NOTE Confidence: 0.894316554069519

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.305
So that's giving you time between now and then to

NOTE Confidence: 0.894316554069519

01:15:11.349 --> 01:15:12.399
get your teams together.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8601120114326477

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.830
So that helps us understand which teams are going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8601120114326477

01:15:14.877 --> 01:15:16.839
be participating and who's in those teams.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8155502676963806

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.887
So the simple Google form, you fit it in, say

NOTE Confidence: 0.8155502676963806

01:15:20.974 --> 01:15:24.989
here's our team as we need that by by tomorrow

NOTE Confidence: 0.8155502676963806

01:15:25.076 --> 01:15:29.352
at 12:00 PM Eastern, there's a GitHub repo and we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8155502676963806

01:15:29.439 --> 01:15:31.359
need that GitHub repo.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9233787655830383

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:35.851
The solution in the GitHub repo will be downloaded at

NOTE Confidence: 0.9233787655830383

01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:38.999
11:59 Eastern Time on October the 23rd.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8576334714889526

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.196
As you don't have much time to get together your

NOTE Confidence: 0.8576334714889526

01:15:42.262 --> 01:15:45.992
solution on the second event that will be hosting, which

NOTE Confidence: 0.8576334714889526

01:15:46.058 --> 01:15:49.388
will be on November the 5th, we will be announcing

NOTE Confidence: 0.8576334714889526

01:15:49.454 --> 01:15:50.720
the semi finalists.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9060138463973999

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.108
So at that point the judges would have gone through

NOTE Confidence: 0.9060138463973999

01:15:53.155 --> 01:15:54.279
all of your submissions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.898382842540741

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:57.240
They would have said, OK, here's the best ones.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7423807978630066

01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.771
And they will, those best ones will be our semi

NOTE Confidence: 0.7423807978630066

01:15:59.817 --> 01:16:00.279
finalists.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7429715394973755

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:04.585
And that name gives the semi finalists an opportunity to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7429715394973755

01:16:04.647 --> 01:16:08.623
create a video presentation outlining their, the how they've gone

NOTE Confidence: 0.7429715394973755

01:16:08.684 --> 01:16:09.479
about things.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8354424834251404

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:13.211
They get that 5 minute video presentation that we're looking

NOTE Confidence: 0.8354424834251404

01:16:13.271 --> 01:16:15.799
for and we need those by November the 9th.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9160764217376709

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:20.502
And then we'll have the finalists, the actual final event

NOTE Confidence: 0.9160764217376709

01:16:20.565 --> 01:16:23.959
and the winner will be announced on November the 13th.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7030192017555237

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.120
And during that event we literally play back the videos.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9212945699691772

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.572
We'll get the judges to talk about the each of

NOTE Confidence: 0.9212945699691772

01:16:28.614 --> 01:16:30.840
the winning submissions and what we liked about them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82709801197052

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:34.422
And then we'll be announcing the winner and it'll be

NOTE Confidence: 0.82709801197052

01:16:34.475 --> 01:16:36.480
like, you know, it'd be like an award.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6084619760513306

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:39.281
It'd be like off the Oscars, just obviously with a

NOTE Confidence: 0.6084619760513306

01:16:39.337 --> 01:16:39.999
better host.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9557375907897949

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.320
That's kind of the whole deal here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7225732207298279

01:16:44.479 --> 01:16:46.496
Just I want to say just to reiterate, because we

NOTE Confidence: 0.7225732207298279

01:16:46.538 --> 01:16:48.974
had lots of questions about deep about the questions about

NOTE Confidence: 0.7225732207298279

01:16:49.016 --> 01:16:49.520
the problem.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8663637638092041

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:53.221
The purpose of the kata is for you to practice

NOTE Confidence: 0.8663637638092041

01:16:53.288 --> 01:16:58.080
coming up and thinking about architecture and thinking about trade-offs.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8642450571060181

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:03.760
It's about you fine tuning skills, learning new skills.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8767273426055908

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:07.699
It's about you thinking deeply about a problem space that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8767273426055908

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:10.612
is new to you, which is great experience in and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8767273426055908

01:17:10.673 --> 01:17:11.280
of itself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8326254487037659

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.883
It's for you to help articulate the trade-offs that you're

NOTE Confidence: 0.8326254487037659

01:17:14.933 --> 01:17:17.716
considering when you come up with a solution and getting

NOTE Confidence: 0.8326254487037659

01:17:17.766 --> 01:17:20.351
good at sharing that with your team members and also

NOTE Confidence: 0.8326254487037659

01:17:20.401 --> 01:17:22.936
with the judges, right, who are going to be looking

NOTE Confidence: 0.8326254487037659

01:17:22.986 --> 01:17:24.079
through this material.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7639412879943848

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:27.253
So coming out of this, we're not necessarily expecting you

NOTE Confidence: 0.7639412879943848

01:17:27.294 --> 01:17:28.439
to build this system, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7789968252182007

01:17:28.439 --> 01:17:30.977
But you will come out of this knowing a knowing

NOTE Confidence: 0.7789968252182007

01:17:31.031 --> 01:17:33.568
a little bit more and being a little bit better

NOTE Confidence: 0.7789968252182007

01:17:33.622 --> 01:17:37.616
at sharing, at communicating, thinking about trade-offs and maybe thinking

NOTE Confidence: 0.7789968252182007

01:17:37.670 --> 01:17:40.154
a bit deeply about, is Jenna I the right thing

NOTE Confidence: 0.7789968252182007

01:17:40.208 --> 01:17:40.639
for you?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9292750954627991

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.480
And if not, why not?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9363060593605042

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.280
And that's the purpose here, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8163102269172668

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.840
It's for you to have some fun as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7167681455612183

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.400
There is hard work in it, don't get me wrong.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6558844447135925

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.709
But you know, the schedule's not it's, it's, it's fairly

NOTE Confidence: 0.6558844447135925

01:17:53.768 --> 01:17:54.360
tight, OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8965807557106018

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:56.400
But I believe in you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8722172975540161

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.423
And I've been, we've been blown away with some of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8722172975540161

01:17:58.460 --> 01:17:59.799
the solutions we've had in the past.

NOTE Confidence: 0.862301766872406

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.970
So lots of resources available for you to download, information

NOTE Confidence: 0.862301766872406

01:18:05.033 --> 01:18:07.679
about how you sign up and everything else.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9522085785865784

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.960
I think we are pretty much done though.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9526364803314209

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:14.320
We've had lots of questions coming in.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8223198652267456

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.820
This is definitely a record for number of questions we've

NOTE Confidence: 0.8223198652267456

01:18:16.864 --> 01:18:18.926
had in the kata, which might come down to maybe

NOTE Confidence: 0.8223198652267456

01:18:18.970 --> 01:18:21.119
me not being precise enough in the problem space.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8258827328681946

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:21.880
I'm not entirely sure.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6438424587249756

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.911
Or maybe just going to get so many excited people

01:18:23.952 --> 01:18:24.159
